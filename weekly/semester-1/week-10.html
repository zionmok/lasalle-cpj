                                <p>another example is the poster for a taiwanese drama named ‘Fated To Love You 命中注定我爰你’, a very popular drama among early Gen Zs.</p>

                                <p>In this drama, the female lead is an office lady who has a very soft personality, so she can’t say no to colleagues that try to give her extra works. The way they give her extra work is with post it notes, which gives her the nickname, ‘post it girl 便利貼女孩”.</p>

                                <h6>This made me think of what I read in Discursive Everything. They mentioned something about having a physical artefact creates a stronger urge for TA to think deeper about the topic/subject. Perhaps having something that can be understood in one glace instead of zooming in and out to get the full idea, would be more effective.</h6>

                                <p>As my target audience is young designers, an abnormal publication size that stands out from the others would more likely to capture their attention.</p>
