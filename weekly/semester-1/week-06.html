                                <p>35 days into this research topic, I’ve accepted that I have to be the biggest nerd towards Design Process. So I researched more on UI/UX methodologies as well. To understand UI/UX designers, I have to familiarise myself with their terms and lingo. Through reading these books and additional articles, I realised that UI/UX methodologies are mostly checklists to use for usability testings. Yes, UI/UX designers should have this lists of items at the back of their mind when making design choices throughout the interface, but it’s so much. how often do designers forget and the product ends up being frsutrating to use?</p>

                                <p>This week was finally wiping away the whiteboard filled with theories, and putting them into containers instead. I was so lost about RPO before the consultation, didn’t know how to organise my thoughts into writings. Jos helped me to see these information from another angle, timeline. Of course methodologies have evolved since the 1960s, I should tell the story from “A long long time ago”.</p>
                                <p>I realised that repository should be a visually enticing research compilation, I really have to think of ways to bring out the content and speak them with my own language based on my understanding of them as a local young designers. After all, this is a research from a designer to designers.</p>
