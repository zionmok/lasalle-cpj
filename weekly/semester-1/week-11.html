                                <p>We went for 2 rounds of sharing with different group of people.</p>
                                <p>First group – naomi</p>
                                <p>Naomi was doing digital fashion and we were looking at the singapore brand Republique, which is mind blowing to have it so close to us. Next, her sketches for her outcome were all very clear and had clear intention.</p>
                                <p>Feedback gotten from her:<br>
                                    - between the user journey map and this cup stats, she prefer the cup stats as it was something physical to interact with, causing a bigger impact.</p>

                                <p>the Round 2 i was teamed up with huijing and gracie. Huijing went on to share her idea of using a packaging box to talk about her target audience (consumers). We suggedted that she could look into PR boxes that influencers get from brands, there are usually extravagant. We then brainstormed together what else can be signified as consumers. Ah! credit card! and it immediately brought my mind to youtrip’s packaging.

                                <p>Gracie’s ideas for her outcomes were incredible. She sound like she got everything covered, we had a hard time to think of something she could improve on. I was repeating her ideas to myself out loud to understand deeper from her TA’s pov. I then realised that her cover for publication seems like it has an opportunity to hint hint abit about the content inside, which is anti-fairytale.</p>

                                <p>> cups ideas are definitely better and clearer to show, but maybe you could look at what else designers use.</p>
