                                <p>When Joselyn and Yasser was sharing about the design outcomes our seniors did for their project, I resonated with Shree Narain’s posters featuring her TA with personas that adopt a “fashion look” style in her posters, directing relating them back to her research topic “A Movement towards Creating Representation in the Media to influence Young Singaporean Men’s Fashion Identities and Challenge Notions of Masculinity.”

                                <p>I remember when Joselyn shared From Ocean to Plate with me as a example to speculative design. She talked about how Xin Qian took a scientist’s words and speculate a future about seafood consumption. Joselyn talked about how she invited friends and lecturers to go through a future scenario or a supermarket and restaurant that only sells jellyfish as the main source of seafood. It was pleasant to finally visually see her design outcome, at least one of them.</p>

                                <p>Joselyn also talked about To Hereafter with me during consultation in the first few weeks as she felt that my project could take on a speculative approach. She explained how Wei Jie adopt the BTO bidding methods for reserving burial spots in Singapore. It was definitely controversial but strong enough to leave a strong impression on me as he used a famiiliar process on something unfamiliar.</p>

                                <p>Tips!</p>
                                <li>Find ways to record the interviews (ask for permission)</li>
                                <li>Make participants comfortable</li>
                                <li>Take observational notes: note should not be solutions, focus on observations, quotes, inferences (use drawings)</li>
                                <li>Be mindful of cognitive bias - You may exhibit the same exact behavior as an interviewee, but you cannot assume their reason for doing so is the same as yours.</li>
                                <li>Guide the conversation, don’t control it. Use active listening techniques to refocus their thoughts without leading the conversation</li>
                                <li>Ask open-ended questions. Uncover feelings, beliefs, and personal stories. Never settle for “yes” or “no” answers.</li>
                                <li>Be prepared to improvise. You never know what people will tell you. If your
                                    interview turns into a more organic conversation you may want to roll with it
                                    — think of it as a checklist of topics you want to cover.</li>
                                <p> Body language: be open and relax, so that your interviewee can feel the same.</p>
