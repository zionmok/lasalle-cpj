Last week I found some interesting points from young designers about what a support system means to them as young designers. Their answers were able to hint at some of the pain points they are experiencing in their daily life and are hoping to get some kind of solution for it.</p>
                                <p>Collating those with the insights gotten from user interviews with young designers a few weeks ago, I categorised them into common themes.</p>

                                <p>According to all the pain points, I’ve created variations of possible MVPs. I then explored some user flows for each MVP to help me compile all of the possible features that could be viable for my target audience. By doing this, I could see all of the possible routes in one glance. Finally, I decide to go with the MVP which helps young designers to ideate better. This MVP seems the most useful through the user interview I’ve conducted with young designers as most of them presented struggles during the ideation phase.</p>

                                <p>This was influenced by my personal interest in nature documentaries since young. Wildebeest is the centre of wildlife. They’re the primary source of food for the real predators of the African Savanna as they bridge the gap between grass and carnivorous predators.</p>
                                <p>One particular documentary, explains how wildebeest herds are constantly on the move to find the next grassland even though the journey is a tough one. In order to find fresh grazing, the herd have to journey through many obstacles such as lion territories, and rivers full of crocodiles. This reminds me of the journey designers have to go through in order to gain experience and adapt their creative process to the demand of the industry. Even though it’s a tough one, creatives still continue to choose the journey for the rewards similar to wildebeests finding woodlands.</p>

                                <p>In this podcast, Paul Boag shares how he goes about a design project. Instead of steps, he likes to describe his processes in chunks. Eg. Discovery, Prototyping, Final. He also charges his clients separately by these phases. Paul explains that this way, the client would not have to commit to the whole project with him especially when it’s their first time working together. Additionally, it would be more realistic to plan the timeline and the budget as he would better understand what the project needs after each phase.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, he also shed some light on the importance of involving the stakeholders in the decision process. Things like allowing them to take the time to gather feedback from people around them with a video instead of a still image will encourage explanation behind the design decisions.</p>
