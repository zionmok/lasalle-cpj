                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    Z: Okay, so this interview will take roughly around 30 minutes. Just to start off, can I understand what kind of design field are you working in right now? <br><br>

                                    N: It's a bit hard to say, it's a mixture of graphic design, advertising, product design. And things that I haven't find the words to describe yet. So my... I think the long story short is the content that I do, that I work with, it involves from your traditional advertising things that you see billboards, movie posters, all the way down to television production, where we create like videos, and then every also we're in things like NFT, metaverses. We also work erm..  or rather, my team also work in experiential design, guidelines, so branding, the usual stuff. Product Design is also do things like the UX, the.. I don't involve myself in the UXR but in the UX design art direction kind of things I do. UI as well, that includes that. I think that's about it, I'd say. <br><br>

                                    Z: how big is your team?<br><br>

                                    N: I think about 20 odd or so?<br><br>

                                    Z: Okay, so officially start the interview. The purpose of this interview is to learn about how mentors, like you, experienced designers, like you, the difference between the design thinking process you do in your company, in the industry, and what you teach us in school or to students or younger designers. So the first question is, could you describe what is the design thinking processes like in your current company?<br><br>

                                    N: It depends on the brief. So my role is sort of like a good in between is kind of a new role. Because my company, they, they figured that they want to try something new. They needed a middle person that knows marketing, to feedback, or like to guide, the product team. And product team also need, like feedback on how to make sure that the product work can scale up to marketing, level of explorations. So I'm that between role right now at the moment. And in terms of how we approach the process, right? So if we start off first with, Okay, we have a product, a new feature on the app. And we want to dive into how to come up with a art direction for the app. So the design process for that is, we will go into UXR first, then we will go into mock ups, they will go to hypotheses. So we'll try to think. And then after that, we'll add in the scalability component, which is for example, let's say we go in this art direction, right? Maybe, you know, a pink and green kind of scheme for the app design. Does that work for the markets around the world? Right, because it might work for US. The team mainly is in the US. So there's that, there's that biasness that everything we see in US we think it will fit for every other, fit for every other country, which is not the case. So because I'm in APEC role, I can you give them from APEC point of view, what roughly agents might think like the design will look like? So sometimes actually, it's quite, quite interesting because when they design text, right, they will go like, Oh, no, I want huge text, bold typography is, is the way to go. And then, and then sure it works, but then I tell them Okay, let's think about how, let's say, if we launched this app in Korea, we launched this in in Thailand, we can do that because Korean tax, they have many strokes in within one character. And if you crop off, if you do big typography, and you crop off some strokes, that's not legible for Korean texts. If we do that the same for Thailand, that's also not going to be the same. Because Thailand texts, just like Bahasa Indonesia, when there's one word, one word in, in English, the word translated to Thai or Indonesian, might be very long, then how you're going to do big typography in in a very small screen. So ultimately, that's that's how we do some of this design process. Of course, I am condensing it into a one two minute kind of conversation having actually there's so much more behind that. But that's one way that we approach it, another one, I want to dive into something a bit different. So that was like from a product level workflow. If we go down to experiential design, things like event, if you're asked to do like, oh we want a brand or event space, how do we go about doing it, then the approach will be different. Normally, I will tell my team is we go down to the venue itself to have a look, we think about how the audience are going to walk in, what they're going to see how they're going to feel. And then we design through that emotional process for our audience. So that is another way that we approach it. Maybe I can pause here, I'm not sure if I'm answering your question.<br><br>

                                    Z: I think you're going in the right direction. So for event, you put yourself in the user, like the audience point of view first, go into the event, how what do they see? How do they feel? So will you design accordingly to what you want to make them feel?<br><br>

                                    N: Yes exactly. So similarly, like I know product, if it's a product app is very different, because product and itself. The experience is very visual, that's about it, they touch and interaction with your app. But again, the same thing, the same process applies as to how do you want your consumer to feel when they land on to this screen? So you know, there is, do you use Netflix? Okay, so there's Netflix, right? There's the normal standard Netflix, and then let's say if there's a Netflix premium, how do you transition a user from what they are saying, from a standard basic point of view to a premium point of view? What should they visually see? So if it's, should they be seeing more gold colour, like instead of red is now more gold? Is it? Maybe the screen is more minimal now, but it's less cluttered? Is that what you want your user to view? So there will be a lot of hypotheses that we will test out and show to our audience? But of course, in parallel to that, that hypotheses, we're also going to ask the users themselves. What do you feel when we say the word premium? Right? Do you, obviously people think, oh, it's, it's, it's posh it's elevated, is it makes me feel everything's personalised for me, I go to I go to homepage, I don't need to, I don't need to find things like you should be the one recommending things that I really want to see. So that's the, we also will do that research alongside that as well.<br><br>

                                    Z: So how about further along into the project?<br><br>

                                    N: Further along on the project was to do testings with our users, we will test with our stakeholders as well. Ultimately, we still have to answer like the big goal that was set by our product officer, chief product officer or chief marketing officer, what do they want in this feature, or app or anything. Or campaign, potentially. So we have to check back with them. And then after we roll out to the audience, right. I think the mistake here is people always think that oh, you roll out something. That's it. People will love it. That's really not the case at this point in time. It's really we launched always is just a phase one. Then we get engaged. We launch it also even by markets first. Then we start testing, we rolling out like okay, let's say a bunch of people feedback. Not very good here. But I like here. Can we improve here, then we will launch phase two, they will launch phase three and then four and then five. And then depending on how long the product roadmap is, by perhaps I stage ten, perhaps the product should be very refined already, such that when we roll out to, we will start rolling out even more audiences around the world, if the feedback is positive, then good.
                                    So that's what your company is doing for product and events, right? at least for that two segments. Yes. I mean, obviously, there are a lot more lah, but I don't know if I want to keep on talking about it. <br><br>

                                    Z: Okay, maybe we'll move on to the next question.<br><br>

                                    N: Unless you have specific questions, then I can answer from my company's point of view.<br><br>

                                    Z: I'm very interested, but for the sake of this interview, we shall move on. So how about the design thinking processes, you teach to your students or your mentees?<br><br>

                                    N: design process that I teach? Okay. Very controversial, but it works for me lah. I am, I, I start from a very, I'm a graphic design trained person. So naturally, if you're in graphic design, you need to be detail oriented. Things like, oh, you can look at your social posts. And you tell me, like, Oh, there's one, there's a one pixel line off. Or, like, these are details that I learned myself as when I was training to be a designer, which is very different from someone who's an art director trained, because when they start off first, they don't start with the design, they start off with the feeling the mood, the emotion. They are storytellers. I mean, we are also storytellers, but we tell in very different ways. So how, when I teach the, at least my my reports, is that first we got to be very detail oriented. To the point that I think I can like some stories of my team, they will say is that they feel scared when they show me their work, because in a good way, not in a bad way. Because they they will always keep double checking, they're always very scared that they send something then the dimension is 1920 or 1080 right? is 1081 Even this one pixel, I will say one, like, I can spot it. So they are very scared like to make these very simple mistakes. But I told them that is I think is, think about it, it's not really a flaw or anything is think of it as like a creative muscle. When you go to a gym, you have to keep training the muscle, then you get there, right? So same thing, what I'm trying to do is teach them a habit, over time, I'm not going to expect them to know to know how to solve these things immediately, the moment I tell them, they will solve it. No, it will take time, they need the habit, to train and train and train until eventually they can export things or do things without like any supervisions or like, oh, yeah, I think you may tell this is what we saw. And then they will pass on that same thing when they check other people's files in the future that this one pixel off or something like that. So that is one thing that I always teach another one is is this thing called knowing the rules. So a lot of people at least in my agency team, when they come in, they will have to know a brand guideline. But a lot of them don't tend to read the brand guidelines because they feel they will they will be trapped in a brand guideline. This is not really my approach because my approach is if you want to bend the rules, you need to know the rules first before you can bend. So for people who tell me that oh don't worry, I can do it like I can I can get there eventually I can do it eventually. I don't need to read all these kinds of things, right? I mean, sure, if they choose to do it, they can but I am not saying that it's right or wrong. It's just my approach. My approach is just that I prefer to know the rules first before I break them, a lot of people just break them immediately without knowing why it was there in the first place. So that is two things I always tell my my reports first.<br><br>

                                    Z: so how about after you give them a brief? Do you teach them like step by step or how do you phrase the brief in order for them to move forward with the project?<br><br>

                                    N: Okay. I would say when Okay, do you know the feeling do you know this Chinese word called gan jue (感觉) so for me, I always, so this one actually the backstory behind this is that was in my very first internship company. There was a lawyer turned director. So He was previously a lawyer, then he turn into a film director. He always tells me when he framed his pictures right, he storyboards. Right? He say, you will need to have the feel,  the gan jue (感觉). So from then on that very first company, right? It just latches on to me. Because initially, it's very hard to understand what you mean. But sometimes when you see your design, right, and then you say, it’s  so nice, it’s well designed Like, everything makes sense. That is the gan jue (感觉) that they're looking for. To know that everything is there at the right place, be it like a poster, be like the brandguide,, be like, an advertisement, film. Whatever you create, as long as you know that. Yeah, that is the feel that I want,. That's great. So I tell my team as well, once the brief has been given to you already right,, you need to first understand what is the gan jue (感觉)? What is the story, perspective, you want to tell? Because I need to train these people to have opinions. A lot of them is they tend to, or you tell me what to do, then I do. Right? They are not, they don't have an idea. You don't have a vision of what's in it. I think it's important to have your own opinions like, Okay, I'll give you 10 briefs. If you read all 10 briefs, you at least need to know, an idea or vision of what you want in your 10 briefs,. Right? Even if they don’t know what they want, it’s fine, at least you they still need to have a visual idea of what it might look like first, then you can you can refine it later on, or you can change it later on as well. But the gan jue (感觉) is needed for every part of the brief, I would say. So every part meaning like when you do a research, right? You haven't started with the brief yet, you do your research first. Is your research heading the right way. Are you asking the right questions? Do you feel like you're making good progress, and this is all in your gut feel. So I don't tend to check in with my teammates very often, like maybe once a week, because I want them to go through the process themselves. I want them to think about it themselves as well. And I think a good way is also to give them the autonomy, to do their own things, to think about it themselves. Because you know, right now I'm telling you, how I'm thinking. But I don't expect people to think the same way as me. Like they can we can meet the goal that we want, which is say the gan jue (感觉) right. But how we get there from A to B, you know, for me it could be like that *draw straight line*, for them maybe is like that *draw zigzag line*. So I don't want to interrupt the process. I just tell them like, at one milestone what you need to do. And then you get there. Of course along the way they can approach me if they're feeling stuck. But I would say that is the one thing that they should kind of know what to do. Have Opinions lah. <br><br>

                                    Z: After you reach the gan jue (感觉) part, then they present to you what they have found through their research. How will you direct them into the next step?<br><br>

                                    N: So we will first look at it from a business point of view. are you answering the brief objective? Right? So if we don't, then no matter how nice you do, how gan jue (感觉) you do, if you're not meeting the objectives, then it's not heading in the right direction. So that's the first thing. The second thing is if they meet the objectives, then we look at it from a visual execution point of view. We think about like, if it's a campaign, right? Does the campaign meet like other things like budget? Does it meet feasibility? Can you produce that? And then we have to go through like how do we sell this storytelling to the stakeholders or to the people that we want to sell it to. So at every stage along the way, there are a lot of check ins I would say. That's how also we shape their idea process. I think other than that, it's pretty much straightforward as with any other briefs, I would say. But I think every leader will have different ways to motivate them ways to guide them on to reaching a certain destination or certain end result.<br><br>

                                    Z: It’s actually very interesting how you say the leaders will have to motivate them to come out of with the  results. Whereas when, when you're working on your own brief, you come in as a user perspective, so what the user wants to feel or things, as your motivation to move forward. But for the students or reports will be their gut feelings, their gan jue (感觉). So why do you think there's a difference in the starting point between your own projects and what you teach? <br><br>

                                    N: Right? So I think, for every creative in this world, I was also telling my team in the LaSalle project as well. Every creative in this room, needs to have their point of view. Because that is what will make you the unique factor when you go out there to work, or who you are as a creative. Because let's say, we are both creative. But the way we absorb creativity, the way we think creative things, right? It's very different. Because in our head, like, I might look at, okay, we might look at, let's say we watch a Pixar film, and then we watch iPhone ad, okay? And then if we mix these two together, right, whatever they are re mixing is, is, is very unique, is unique to me, it's unique to us, it’s unique to everyone. So think about it. Everyone, we react to References, we look at Pinterest, Behance, everything, anything else, right? But how we infer this information, and then we like, you know, mash it up and then come up with something is the unique puzzle. That is your identity. Now, I was telling them, right? You can think of something, a work. And then when you go there, and then you sell right? Do you want to come up with a word that either has been done before? Like, quite common, quite basic, like, you look to any website, you can tell, it's a rebranding project, you go to anywhere else, it’s also a rebranding project. then how are you going to differentiate yourself when you go out into the industry. So the remixing factor is the one that I want every creative to have a point of view. And similarly, when I teach my direct reports, right, this is the end goal. end  goal is we want to launch a, let's say, the UX one right, we want to launch a new feature to a new audience, that’s the goal, Now, how you get there, I want everyone to bring in their own gan jue (感觉), their own gut feel their own version of what they think, is the defining factor. Because then we are making two things, I'm meeting the objective, I'm also making the stakeholders happy, and then also meeting the creative growth as well. Because they will feel good if something that I created on my own is pushed out there. Then, so where I come in as the middle person, is I have to facilitate both the business objectives, and then how to get my team to do something that is both fulfilling, but also meeting the goals.<br><br>

                                    Z: How about for yourself? You tend to go into the user perspective first, why is that? Why do you not..?<br><br>

                                    N: Oh, like why do I do that? I think, okay, well, one thing first is because I work in Google, Google is we work for our users, like we, in our core values, right? Google core values, right? There's this thing called Know the User, which means we need to really know who we are talking to. Right? Once we know their needs, then we come up with solutions that meet their needs. Yeah, that's how we connect the dots. And also that's part of the Google philosophy, like our core values, which is we connect all these dots and then we, make the magic. And also, personally for me, I think is,  if you don't work for the user, if you work for yourself is so selfish. I mean, there are other creative roles that you can create work for yourself, like pro bono works or works that personal projects, there is work that you create for yourself. But when I create my day job, all these, is create for the audience, there's also satisfaction for me.<br><br>

                                    Z: Interesting. So from your experience, right? Between your interactions with your students or mentees? What are some common struggles that you see them face in the design thinking process?<br><br>

                                    N: I think one.. okay. A couple of them. One of them is they feel they don't know what's the playground. So when I say playground right, think of your head, the space in our head is a playground. So when I give you a brief, they are thinking all their ideas like what can be done, what cant be done, it’s in that playground. And sometimes, these playgrounds, the walls, right is built by yourself. And it's very difficult to come out of the playground to think out of the box, essentially. The common feedback is ‘oh, I didn't know I could do that.’ Another one I hear is ‘oh, I don't know how to do that’ as well. And that is one struggle that I do face with when I work with, say, very junior people is that they do not know, what is the playground that they can play in. So sometimes the solution here that I always do is I tell them, I give them guidance on where is this playground. So for example, I give one of the students a example here that I can use for this one. If the brief is to create a Gen Z version of say McDonald's, right? What is the, I guess the most common answer that you will get is Oh a Gen Z version of Mcdonald’s will be, oh just different colours, different branding. The menu will be different, the store design will be different, right? But would that be it? Wouldn't that be quite common as with other branding, rebranding projects as well? So then I give them more examples of Oh, what if the McDonald's do collaborations with other brands, with fashion with festivals with going to NFTs or metaverse, that kind of collaborations. So that is one way how I tell them that okay, so then they think beyond what's McDonald's already. They think McDonald's is not a fast food brand, but just a brand. A bigger brand. I think of McDonald as a fashion brand. Think of McDonald's as a toy brand as well. Now, once you think like that, then you think okay, a toy McDonald, what would that look like a fashion McDonald? What would that look like? And, of course, what I'm saying all this is all has been done before, because I'm sure you've seen McDonald fashion apparels. Right. But that is like me setting, the boundary of the playground to let them know that they can think beyond that as well.<br><br>

                                    Z: I see, so like breaking down the walls of their playground?<br><br>

                                    N: So walls is one thing I would say. And second I think is confidence. But I think that's rightly so because I think I also can remember when I was starting out as well, I didn't really dare to sell ideas.
                                    Like there's always that fear that is not good enough. Or is shitty ideas or is ideas that will be laughed at. And I think this one, unfortunately, is due to the culture. So as a person last time in that role, right? I try my best to make sure that, you know, there is no, like, really, there's no foolish ideas. I rather them think through all the foolish ideas, say all the foolish ideas out and then they can like they can rest in peace, move on in peace. Because they will keep on going back and think oh man, I should have present that idea, will that idea work anot, right? I don't want it to get stuck in your head. I want them to just say it out and then we talked about it and if can, we will work on. if it doesn't then it won't. Right. So I think it's mostly dependent on the leader, on how the person set the context of the room. Set the mood in the room as well, the learning environment, tell everyone this is a learning environment. Don't be afraid to voice out, every idea is celebrated here. Do not hold back essentially right. If you have an idea, any idea just say it, we can all talk about it in the room. So I think it's really, that one is unfortunately a very leader position to be the one to make sure that the room is confident enough to say what they want.<br><br> 

                                    Z: That's very nice. <br><br>

                                    N: So I think that's the main 2.<br><br>

                                    Z: Do you also experience these kind of struggles when you just started in the industry?<br><br>

                                    N: Yeah, for sure. I mean, that's how I know it also, I can see in you know, I know what I'm feeling and I can see in the juniors as well.<br><br>

                                    Z: How did you overcome those? Do you also have a mentor and a leader who created this safe space to voice out your ideas?<br><br>

                                    00:30:12:26 - 00:30:28:10
                                    N: Obviously there was a, back then I, I didn't have really have a... I had good colleagues to work with, but I wouldn’t consider them a mentor because they were, at best they were like fleeting because they were there for a while then, you know. Ya, temporary.
                                    But I treat it, I trea..t and also I have bad ones as well, like bad managers. Now, I think it comes down to what you want to get out of your career. if you want to be a leader right, then whether you have good or bad mentors, or mentees, or managers as well, you just need to know to figure out what you want to pick up from them.<br><br>

                                    Z: Pick up all the good things and things like that?
                                    N: So even the bad managers right, they are there to teach you a lesson also, because you know next time I shouldn't be like that. right. Uh, for example, last time I have a manager right, likes to promise me very good things. Tells me I can go to France on a work trip, things like that. And then when the day comes, then she ‘oh no, can you work on this project? You cannot go. I will go.<br><br>

                                    Z: It’s jogging up so much memories, okay.<br><br>

                                    N: So I mean, everyone faced it, I faced it as well. Yeah. So. Yeah. So it happened to me and I know next time as a manager, what I should not do, like, number one, Incentivizing work is okay, Right? But do not guarantee, do don't give false hopes that the person will eventually, work day and night over something and then not going for it. That is, that is shitty ah. That's a very bad example. So and eventually for me, what I learned from that is I didn't, I never go for my trips, I get my art directors to go instead. Because they can learn more from me. I already go on trips and art direct shoots already, so I just told them, eh I remote in Singapore, you go down there on ground to learn. So that is one advice I can say. Take out all these individuals and it might not even be your mentor as well. It could be a colleague. Like if I have colleagues that are similar like me as well, very detail oriented. So that's one thing I pick up from them. Yeah, I find it is a skill that helps me survive in what I do. so. Yeah, I just picked it up.<br><br>

                                    Z: I’m also trying to be detail oriented.<br><br>

                                    N: And again, it's a habit. Like you're not saying that you will get it in the next month or the next year, that’s just a habit thing. Everything is a habit honestly.<br><br>

                                    Z: Muscle memory.<br><br>

                                    N: Even when you, let's say I'm not sure if you want to become a manager in the future, but let's say you do right? You're not going to be a perfect manager on day one. I wasn't a perfect manager on day one also. Yeah, it's a everything's a muscle like that. You just have to train.<br><br>

                                    Z: I see. I think that's all for my interview. Do you have anything else to add?<br><br>

                                    N: No, but I mean, that's cool. And I like this interview.<br><br>

                                    Z: That’s good! This is interesting. You’re working under Google but in the youtube branch is it?<br><br>

                                    N: Ya. Do you use youtube?<br><br>

                                    Z: Everyday.<br><br>

                                    N: Yeah, Thanks. Thanks for being a user.<br><br>
