                                <p>Dhiya <br>
                                    I'm Dhiya. I'm a graphic designer. And I've been graphic designing for two years. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Have you been in a team at your workplace? And how big is the team? <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Recently it's three. Usually it's about one or two. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    What kind of roles are there in your team? <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    In a team, there's one or two designer, usually one will be the leading designer and another one with the assistant or CO designer, usually I'll be helping out because I'm still very new, then there will also be an account manager, to liaise with designer and the client and copyrighter. The copywriter will help to oversee the content and the copy that comes out. The account manager will also handle the business aspect. And sometime the creative director will come in, where they will be the bridge between the the business and the creative side. Basically the account and the creative director will handle the the admin the business stuff, to control the designers just in case they go crazy with the idea. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    What are your responsibility as a designer in the team? <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    My responsibilities in the team is to assists and give out ideas for the project. Yeah, help out with the ideas, the executing by like, designing the stuff and all. So yeah, that's basically the role of a CO designer. Yeah. And I suggest any ideas that it's valid and relevant to the project. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Can you share with you the design process your creative team go through?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Usually, when it comes to pitching ideas, what I notice is that there will always be back and forth between the designer and the client. and the account manager will be the one handling the two sides of the bridge, Okay. So, from what I observe and what I have done was that we read the brief and then we try to understand it and decipher the brief. So whatever the brief say, let's say they want like a social post or like trying to rebrand style. So we need to like gather what kind of brand aesthetic will be suitable for the brand itself. So what I usually do is we will look at the website, the the existing website, the products that we have and the logo and See what kind of aesthetic they do. So I think there will be like deciphering the information, the current version that they have, and what they request for. So when we link those two together, it’s like maths.. So like one plus three will be four. So yeah, so we're trying to find the answer to that whole deciphering and understanding the brand and what they want. So the ideation part. So usually, it will be in the form of sketches, or Pinterest. Just finding existing examples from like similar brand that is related to the client’s brand itself. So I think ideation. then after that, once it's like kind of a approced, then we will give like a mood board or for look and feel. let's say like, straight off the bat, the moodboard is okay, then we'll proceed to executing. If not, they will have to revise again. So usually, you can come up with like a draft, a key visual that can help to visualise the idea. So usually during this ideation, it will come in like a form of sketches, or like drafts, visuals that will help to better visualise the idea to what the client wants, then let's see if it's okay, that we'll start executing the end product, if not, then we'll go back to ideating again, and finding other references again. So a lot of back and forth between ideating and drafting. copywriter will also play a part. Cause some posts there will be certain copies or tone that the brand wants. So the copywriter will help craft the tone, because maybe like designers or accounts may not be able to properly express the brand itself.<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Just now was about team right, how about you yourself? What is your creative process like?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Because it's a fast paced environment or and I tend to be quite slow. What I'll do is, I'll quickly find ideas on like Pinterest, or Behance, or maybe like existing brands, and just quickly put up the work, and then just execute that visual or feel on Photoshop or Illustrator. Yeah, so I don't really sketch which is apparently not a good thing, you have to sketch because it's best to visualise or sketch out the whole thing rather than wasting time on it, if you’re either not confident or don't have any solid idea. Yeah, so usually, what I'll do is I'll find inspirations on design websites, and then execute the idea on design softwares. Yeah, it's a very straightforward thing. So that will also cause a back and forth. So let's say the client doesn't like design that has been executed or propose, or my own colleagues or my creative director doesn't like it. Then I have to redo again. So I think a lot of time will be taken will be during the discussion part for each iterations.
                                    this question is usually variations. usually, before we're like really solid on the idea, we'll discuss it with our with our colleagues, so it’ll be internal first, so once everybody agrees on the same idea like, Okay, this is okay. Then we will pitch it to the client. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Just now you mentioned that apparently no sketches is a bad thing, what makes you think that? It is someone told you?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    I feel like, I wasn't really used to the idea of sketching at first. I feel like, recently, my creative director told me to do sketches when can and if should. because sometimes when you execute it on the dot, right, the idea may not come out as clean, it can come out messy is like, literally, you're drawing your thoughts. And it's like, it's not clean enough, unless you like sketch and you can have an overview of what your design will look like, the layout. And then like, if let's say the sketches layout design is good, that you can just do without any hesitance, while I if let's say the layout is not good, then at least you can still work on the layout again, and without spending time on the softwares. And it's also to save time and effort. You can also do that with your clients also, so if you want to propose a certain layout, and then you don't want to waste time doing the whole layout on Illustrator, you can just sketch out abit, it saves you time.<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    The process you just mentioned, where did you get it from?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Definitely not from school. Maybe because I wasn't from visual comms, so maybe my experience is a bit different. So from what I learned in school, is product design. And it's very straightforward, ideation then sketch then draft, prototype. And the prototype is okay, then execute it. But what I learned more is from work, and that is to have more open discussions. Yeah, I learned mostly this from experience and work. basically very different from school with work is that the time, the pacing. because you're handling with, like, deadlines and all that you need to be fast. So you need to really think really, really, really quick. Which is something that is not being practised in school. I think they're mostly from experience and maybe Youtube. So sometimes people will teach on how to do branding, kind of thing. So that's how I learn.<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Which part of the process do you find the most challenging?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Two parts. Ideating and pitching. So I think sometimes when the brief is given to you, you don't even know what they're talking about. Right? they will say, oh, I want to look to be cool. Like, okay, what is cool, too, you can be different from what is cool to me. So it's very hard. And designers tend to sometimes think in their own way, I'm not speaking for everybody, but for me personally, it gets in the way where I'll be like, Okay, this design is not cool. I think this is cool. But you're not working for yourself. You're working for the client. So the client think that is cool then that is, you know. Yeah. So I think ideation it's one especially you know, to find the right keywords and research to better like execute the idea. And then pitching, believing in yourself and your story, the designers always tend to have self doubt. I mean, for me, especially, I tend to have self cdoubt, like when halfway  you're like believing in the idea like Okay, it's good, it's good, it's good. And suddenly, maybe when you're like starting to pitch or you're like,  actually maybe it's not that good. But you're already like, go through the idea. So those two parts are the most difficult one I think. I think like that is like finding ideas or inspiration is easy. You just have to be decisive of what you choose. But the ideating part and the pitching part are one of the worst process that I face. Yeah. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    To summarise, is that when you get a brief, and you don't get the clear information you need, confidence die off, or like, the excitement for your own ideas die off after awhile. when you're pitching to clients, you find it difficult to express confidence to convince your client that this is a good idea. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Yeah. Yeah.
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    The next question is abit sidetracked. How often do you see other designer’s processes?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Okay, maybe not that often, once, every three months or so, I think my colleagues share a similar design process with me, or maybe it's different, I'm not too sure. Because we're all working together, and the company culture, kind of like you have to kind of adapt to their design process. But how I see other people, maybe once every few months, or once every six months or so. Because the only places that I can see this process conveniently will be on YouTube. So on Youtube, graphic designers will always share their design process, right? Yeah, so when I have the time and the feels, then I’ll watch it on youtube. <br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    How about peers?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    I don’t know, how do I answer that?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Actually, I’m trying to find out why designers subconsciously do not share about their design processes. And also why do some people share, since everyone have slightly different process. Usually there’s only Youtubers who are sharing their process since it’s part of their work. If it’s just for personal, I feel that there’s isn’t much. How about you, what do you think?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    For my peers, I kind of work in that environment and they do it a certain way. And I kind of adapt to that way. So I’ll it's quite often. And maybe like for them, they're willing to share their design process. If like, let's say you ask and they're willing to share. which is quite, quite interesting. as well. Whereas in my past experience, it’s very rare to be for them to share. I think yeah, most designers I know they wouldn't really share unless you ask or maybe if you asked also they won't be very honest with answers.<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    If I can ask you to imagine anything under the sun that can help you with your design process, like all the challenges that you have mentioned, like the brief and pitching, what can helo with that?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    For the brief, that one is very subjective, because different people will work differently. But definitely designers will love it if the brief is very clear. But then again, sometimes clients already know what they want. They can have a feel, but they don't know how to execute it or properly articulate their thoughts, that’s going to be difficult for them.. But if they can do that easy. it's very subjective. So I think brief, definitely will love it if it's clear. But that's a given. I think for pitching, what will be helpful will be examples or ideas on how to better express your ideas. definitely examples or advice that can help designers to pitch their ideas. So maybe like crash course or the articles that can be helpful, and maybe definitely, if like in school, it should be subject to teach to students, regardless of which design course they are, if they're in the design course, they should have this course or a subject or to instil this confidence pitching or practice to pitching ideas to people, and better articulate their ideas. Yeah, I think that'll be helpful.<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    You talked about the confidence level of young designers being not very high, that’s why we need to instil the confidence level in young designers. Why do you think caused such low confidence within young designers?<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    I think that the reason for low confidence, it can come from external and internal factors. Internal factor, definitely plays a part. Impostor syndrome, insecurities, stuff, that will definitely factor your confidence. But that also can be helped. Because at the end of the day you are your own person. So if you really believe in the idea, you have to believe it. External factors, I believe that it also plays a part. because designers are in a creative industry, and everybody is very creative, full of feelings, right? So obviously, when there isn't any constructive criticism and comments are like ‘it's ugly, it’s bad’ Okay but tell me why it's bad. Obviously, without any good reason or explanation or any good constructive criticism, obviously, the designer is gonna feel very insecure. And they're gonna feel very upset about it. Then it become personal. then affect the internal factor, which will result in low confidence. Wow, I just connected the dots.<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Yeah, maybe you already know subconsciously, but you don't really think of it everyday, why are we doubting ourselves and being so hard on ourselves. But people don’t see how much criticisms we have taken over the years.<br> <br>
                                    
                                    Dhiya <br>
                                    Exactly. Yeah. And I think it should be practised in school or outside, that giving constructive criticism should also play a part. For everybody, everybody from designers to like, managers or whatever. If, let's say the work is not good, give a reason why, with a fair judge. Yeah, so I think that's also the reason why designers always self-doubting themselves, no confidence, because most of the time in the environment that they're exposed to. So let's say if they're in a very constructive, or, like, fair judgement environment, obviously, they're gonna, they're gonna be surrounded with this kidn of criticism, and it wouldn't affect their confidence level, not too much, I think. But let's say if it's in an environment where everybody is very judgmental, or very critical about how you do your things, then it's definitely got to play a part in the designers themselves. So yeah, and also, how we receive the comment also, that also plays a part but yeah, definitely should be practice. That your criticism should be a fair judgement, and you shouldn't be it shouldn't come out as personal.<br> <br>

                                    For yourself, at your current stage, what do you think can help with building your self-confidence for sharing your ideas to your team and clients?<br> <br>

                                    If let's say the work that you're in, is not giving you the chance to speak up, then definitely find other places to speak up. Yeah. Hinting. Definitely practice somewhere, even if it's not about design, you can like let's say like, like, with your friends, or whatever, you don't like certain things or you want to try cexrtain things, you got to practice the confidence by saying, ‘I don't want to do this’ or like, ‘I don't feel like going out today’. I think it's small. Yeah. Learning to say no. when to say no. So personally, I always find it hard to say no. But like, once you expose yourself to practice it more, with other people, external or at work, the more you learn how to build that boundaries, believing in your own opinion, and build that confidence to pitch with. basically just practice in everyday life. It's literally like muscle training. Like, if you see someone who always disturb you, you need to say ‘no, I don't want to be disturbed.’ Rven with a friend, you gotta practice that kind of stuff.<br> <br>

                                    If we go back to the processes, do you think it’s important for everyone to have the same process?<br> <br>

                                    Not really, because what works for me might not work for you. But I believe that there should be some common ground. I’m thinking in a work aspect, let’s say internally you need to share an idea, maybe fixing a day to share their ideas. During the brief and sharing of ideas, how you want to find the idea is completely up to you. There should be that freedom but also some sort of common ground, final goal. The process should be a flexible one in my opinion, because everybody works differently. But the outcome should be there. At the end of the day, the outcome is how well you can deliver the idea. I would say it’s not entirely important.<br> <br>
