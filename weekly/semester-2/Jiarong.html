                                    Jia Rong <br>
Iâ€™m working in Deloitte Digital, doing UI/UX. When I was studying in Lasalle, I was oding freelance for advertising agency, Havas. My first full time job after graduating is BBH, the big part was UI/UX, the day to day bread when I first started was UI/UX. Websites, apps, campaigns. Afte that i hopped onto consultancy. BEcause during my poly times, it was very straightforward, I was going into digital advertising, but in my past experience I had a touch with UX, and now is the main focus.<br><br>

Zion<br>
First question, can you describe what is the design thinking process like in your current company?<br><br>

Jiarong<br>
Because we're a consultancy space, we work with a lot of different types of people. Deloitte has a lot of different offerings, and i'm part of the offering that does UI/UX design and customer strategy. But its also a supplement to the different factions of Deloite. And also depending on the kind of project that comes in, it could be a government project or like a pharmaceutical company, or recently I did one for luxury fashion, so depending on which part of the process you're being fit into, then it kind of differs from project to project.<br><br>

But maybe let me give something that is a bit more design centric. Like when i'm given a brief for, for example, a website, the first thing is kind of to determine what are the requirements of deisgning the website. And at that point you decide what's your target audience, whether you already have existing assets from the client, is it deisgning something from the ground up or is it something that you just want to do a refresh? Then we have to then kind of align that with the brand guidelines.<br><br>

One recent example that I did was for Abbott, the milk powder brand, there was a lot of different milk powder that is under Abbott, so they kind of wanted to do a unified design. If you were to go to some of the different South East Asian websites, the products all look different, so brief was actually to kind of unify the design system. So then that is another faction to think about, which is about like design systems, and making sure how can we unify everything without spoiling the brand and the guidelines. <br><br>

So that was the first step, we kind of gathered the requirement, what we kind of need, and what we should and should not do, and after that we start to charge along in terms of understanding the audience a bit more. When we first got the brief, we determined the requirements and we spoke to the client side stakeholders, "what exactly do you want to achieve?". We did that through a workshop, so that we can get into the client's mind about what they're thinking of, and what the refresh means to them. Because sometimes when you say a brand refresh or a brand new refresh, it means different things to different people, so we kind of want to have a more unified view of what the brands think. And then also understand what they what they want to do, then we can kind of just have a unified vision of how we can achieve that. Right? So from then on, then we move on to talking to our potential target audiences. What do you like in a website? What do you look for in a website? What do you not like in a website? You know, stuff like that. And how do you visit a website, what information you look out for. So it's all this kind of stuff, that we can try to understand, you know, the psyche and the mindset of the potential target audience. Then there's a lot of playing all this information back to the clients, right. And then making sure that everyone's aligned, making sure that the overall poll is aligned with what the audience wants to do. Because at the end of the user experience, I mean, that the word user is first right. And I think  that's, that's a very important point, because he has to the users first, even though sometimes the clients will be like, I pay you the money, you should do what I want. But at the end of the day, you're trying to solve the users problems, right. So that's what's important. But also, you know, you kind of have to juggle the clients ego versus like, what you feel will be the best practice to do for the customers and the consumers themselves. So there's a very big juggling act, in that sense. So yeah, so then that's the research part. So then we get on to kind of trudging along with the design. Then we kind of think about what goes where, what kind of information that they want to see first on the website and all that knowledge bank, putting the wireframes, sharing with the clients, if they're happy, okay, we go set, do mood boards and all that stuff. So that at this point is, is sort of similar to what we might be doing in Lasalle, right? Putting together mood boards about the art direction, how we should design it, then we go on to the mi-fi wireframes that kind of add some colour to the wireframes. Bring it back to clients, again, making sure that they're okay and aligned. Then we started doing like the clickable prototypes, and then as close as close as possible to what we hope the final product will be.<br><br>
Then we work very closely your clients about that. Okay. Yeah, maybe they think that this particular section of the website should move on up and down. So there's another workshop exercise that we do, right. So it was interesting where we had to actually print out like very, very long websites and cut them up. And then just as we rearranged a bit physically, that makes things a bit easier. It's a bit, it's a bit troublesome, but it makes things a lot a lot easier for them to kind of visualise, right? And also, to kind of make sure that okay, the typical mother of the Philippines would want to see this information first, how would you then rearrange the sections in this website, then they would just kind of flip the sheets of paper around, and they were kind of take note. Then once everyone's aligned, and okay, we bring those prototypes to back to the users themselves. So we do user research with them, whether they can understand how to go to certain parts of the website, for example. Okay, so for example, we are given scenarios, and you're looking try these new products, but I'm not very sure what kind of pages will you go to, right? So then from then on, we kind of decidewhat their paths are, in terms of like, within the website, for example, versus like, you know, what we think would be the fastest way to get to these pages. So then we kind of synthesise those information that we get from the user testing. And then when we also interview them about how do they feel when they have to go to this website? Or is it is this kind of information easy to find for them, you know, stuff like that. And then you know, then then we bring it back and forth with the clients and then see how we kind of want to decide whether we want to change it completely, very drastically, the user journey, right? Or we just kind of want to stick to what we already have, and we take note for the future. And that you will constantly be iterative. So you do something, you test it, bring it back, then talk to the clients, clients that oh, yeah, maybe not, maybe, maybe yes. And then you can kind of just move things around, and all that and then you iterate again, and then bring it back to the customer, bring back to yourself, and kind of fix them fix things along the way. So I think when it comes to UX design that there isn't really a final product per say, right? Until the client sign the papers and like getting the money. for example, if you have your own product, right, it will constantly be in the data, you're always looking for new ways to improve, and kind of keep up with the trends, right, in terms of like UX navigations, and all that nonsense. I think it's quite a condensed explanation of what I do as a UX consultant in Deloitte.<br><br>

Zion<br>
I see, okay, there's there was very, very insightful. I didn't know thereâ€™s so much back and forth between clients and users. So just now you mentioned like, during the workshop, you're all the clients that okay, typical mothers of Philippines want to see this first on the website, then they will rearrange, right? Where do you get that information? From the initial information? <br><br>

Jiarong<br>
Right. So when we first do the user interviews, what kind of information do you want to see all that stuff? Right? So then we from there on, then we kind of prioritise what kind of information that we want to put forth to the customers. While at the same time, trying to get like more qu alitative insights from them, When you go to a website, what do you want to see? What's the first kind of information you want to see? that's kind of the new kind of information that is pumped back to us before we kind of just like, okay, according to these insights that we got from acquires, this is what we've done. And we have to make sure that whatever that we design can be backed up by whatever research we've done, itâ€™s not just anyhow pull out of the air one. Because at the end of the day, we have a lot of assumptions of what kind things that people might want to do, want to search for. But at the end of the day, if you talk to when you talk to them, then you realise Oh, actually, your assumptions are wrong, but that's a good thing, because then you actually validated or proven wrong from youraAssumptions.<br><br>

Zion<br>
From the start of the project, to the end of the project, which is when the client sign, and give you the money, right? How many user testing do you work with normally, average?<br><br>

Jiarong<br>
It really depends on the nature of the project and also reality sometimes also, it really boils down to kind of budgets that we have, right? So obviously, it would be best if we can get at least five per deliverable. But for us, because we had to do five, five websites across three different countries, so it's five times three, we did 15 interviews, and those are moderator interviews. Right? So, literally, we sat down one hour with them, we have a list of questions to ask them. And then we have a chat, right. But on top of that, also, that we also have partner, where we made use of the platform where we did unmoderated testing. We just put the figma prototype, we put on the questions we just let the user do by themselves. That platform actually does the screen recording. Then we just get them to voice out, â€˜Okay, yeah, now I'm thinking of going to the to the page to get samples, I'm not rational that should be clicking. So let me just try to click here.â€™ So these are moderated testing also happen. And that is about like 10 people per brand. So it's about 50, but the one is, we just give them our requirements of what kind of people we want to interview, to test. These are the questions and we just get a platform to do it for us. So it's a balance of like, what kind of data you want to get. If you want more qualitative insights, right, then more so moderated testing, where actually interview and have a face to face or over zoom whatever, right? To have a chat with them, to get into their minds, right, versus like quantitative data, then you can go for a moderator where you kind of want to see just how fast they get to that certain pages, how many clicks they will take to get to certain pages, you know, and all that stuff. And then how they interpret the information also.<br><br>

Zion<br>
If you were to have an intern come into your company, and you're in charge of them right, would you also go through the process to them as you would yourself?<br><br>

Jiarong<br>
With interns in the company right, they'll sit in together with the meetings and the discussions internally and also with the clients, right? So then they generally am able to what are the step by step process, and then when they kind of want to understand more, or they're not not sure, they ask us. because unfortunately, most of the time, there isn't really much time to â€˜Okay, so here we are doing thisâ€™  then we like really go into detail and hold our hands up for the process, there are times that we can do that. But most of the time, we are really depending of the interns to ask us the questions. Unless we really need them to do something very specific or whatever. â€˜So at this point, we need you to do this because of these reasons ABC.â€™ then they'll just kind of learn along the way. Right. And then they will ask questions along the way also. they also kind of like supporting us through the design process.<br><br>

Zion<br>
From your experience with interns, right, are there any common struggles that they usually face? Or they usually ask you? Are there any common questions that need they need help with?<br><br>

Jiarong<br>
Because the nature of Deloitte also, right, it has consultancy layer of it. Right? And so sometimes when people and even myself I'm just trying to grasp also because I came from agency background, but there are people who came in straight from design, very, very creative centric ones, right, then they kind of struggle with like, the, the consultancy side of things, right? Because  you really, really need to make sure you are ducks in a row, your research needs to be very gao (deep) And whatever insights you have must be backed. and you must be able to rationalise and explain whatever that you have. So it's more so in that, that a lot of the interns that I've worked with are still trying to learn.<br><br>
I think they apply whatever they learned from like, design school to to work, right, which is not wrong, right. Because whatever that I've learned from the lasalle, when I went to agency, and when I got to where I'm at right now, you know, it really helps if the application, is just that the process is really squeezed, condensed, you need to do the same amount of work, but much shorter time. I mean, the plus side is that you have team members to work with, then you can divide and conquer and all that stuff, but is the thinking on your feet and making sure that you don't screw up. I think that's interns are afraid of. Okay, Deloitte is quite a monster, 10s of 1000s of people in the in the company, but when we tell them that because youâ€™re interns, its fine, we'll cover your ass, and all that. But obviously, we try our best, and we just try to fix but obviously when it gets to the point where you're not you're not helping the process, then we just pull you out and do something else first. We don't have time to be pitchy about things. But we also don't have time to dwell on mistakes. So we have a lot to quickly move on. So I think I think in that sense of pacing wise, that is the sort of what, I guess some some interns are trying to come to consensus with.<br><br>

Zion<br>
So you feel that theyâ€™re playing catch up with the whole company, and the project timeline, is the part where they most struggle with?<br><br>

Jiarong<br>
Sort of but I think that's with every intern I guess. I don't think it's it's industry specific. I think in that sense, I think students now are very used to working in silos, like your projects are individual and all that stuff, the when it comes to like a bigger team, and then they will divide and conquer.Then it'll be like, where do I fit in? How do I fit in and all that, you know, cause I think I think a lot of a lot of students will come in as interns to Deloitte, I think a lot of them are very competitive and very driven. So a lot of them they want to bao ga liao (cover everything themselves) because they want to impress so that they can hopefully get a job after that. But at the end of the day, they cannot, because sometimes they just don't have the skills yet. And it's not their fault. It's just that they're just not at a point in their career where they know how to do certain things. it's about managing their own expectations versus managing the expectations of the company. And I think it's something that I think a lot of people who are entering, myself included when I first joined the industry, right? we want to perform, we want to do a lot of different things. Right. But then you haven't learned anything yet how can you perform? is the kind of struggle. then I think a lot of young creatives, I think just the people who are entering the workforce in general are struggling with.<br><br>

Zion<br>
I see, how do you yourself overcome that problem? Having to manage your own expectations with the companies one? <br><br>

Jiarong<br>
Yeah, I think I faced more of that when I was in my previous job, when I was a BBH for four years. I think at that point, there was a lot of expectation on my own because like it was my dream company to be at. And I was playing with a lot of big names in the industry. So I really wanted to kind of figure things out and just like be able to impress but I think I think what was good is that two things, one from a mentor is that at the end of the day, is just advertising. No one's gonna die. Right? Take it easy, and go along for the ride, obviously do your best, but if things if things screw up along the way, itâ€™s okay, no one's gonna die. It's not that serious. Secondaly, the second advice was actually from Jos. I atually take this advice from Jos really seriously. â€˜you're gonna work from now on ,all the way till you die. Take it easy as you go along. Don't beat yourself up over things don't really matter at the end of the day. Right? And you have own expectation and all that stuff. But also you have to kind of realise that is this even in my capacity to learn and do? And if itâ€™s not withing my capacity to do, can I help to support so that I can then learn from that process? Versus like, oh my god, I need do this now. I need to do this now. And then like, if I don't do this to my own reputation, I feel very sad, I feel like oh my god, I'm underperforming. I'm disappointing myself. But then I realised actually no lah. Now I think back, I was just like a younger creative where I was like, oh, I want to do everything. I want to conquer the world and all that stuff, right? There are different steps in your career and you're expected to do different things in each step. So don't don't try to force yourself into something that's like way above what you should be doing. I'm not saying to slack. but there are some things that you genuinely need the time and the years to understand how to do some stuff, right, before you can actually do it. And I think I think I didn't realise that last time. And I wanted to just like, the smallest setback I would be beating myself up last time, and that's not productive. Rather than dwelling on the setback, take a step back, think about it, how can I improve, then learn from there and then move on. versus, taking it so seriously, and just like, the upset the whole time when I when I feel I'm underperforming. So I think I think realising those new things, no one's gonna die, and also youâ€™re going to work until you die. So might as well just enjoy the ride, enjoy the process.<br><br>

Zion<br>
Yeah, Jos  keep telling us as well. Weâ€™re not trying to save the world from like, disasters or whatever, just set your goal, which is within your reach realistic goals, and achieve them and move on.<br><br>

Jiarong<br>
But like, it's much easier to learn how to manage after being exposed to a lot of different types of clients, different types of people, on different departments versus like, if you're just like an in house designer, or starting a UX team, and then you have to juggle, then then then the product, the issue would then be in managing internal politics, right, which may not be that good for your own growth on the craft. Which I feel like, when you're starting out, it's more important to hone your craft more, once you're very good at or then go directly, then you have to touch on the other things, right? Like the very typical admin stuff, like the home, office, politics, law, your administrative problems, managing clients, you know how to talk to them. Those are also skills in that those are also important skills to survive in the workplace. But if you're going in as a junior, right, don't look at all those first. just care about your own craft. Because thatâ€™s the most important before going on to the next stage where like managers, then you'll have to manage people. So yeah, but I think whatever you can, just get whatever kind of opportunities can get, I think that's that's, that's just the fun of it.<br><br>
