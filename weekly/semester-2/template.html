                                <p>Last week, Joselyn reminded us that we should somewhat finalise our discussion points by the first consultation, so we can get constructive feedback for it and continue working on it through the following week. Gideon has also given us some feedback on how our studio can improve. For my projects, he mentioned that my take on “uncovering the attributes of design thinking” could be presented stronger and clearer by expanding on why am I doing it, for example “as a way of questioning its relevance today”. I could take this comment onto my dissertation discussion points. <br><br>

                               <p> Previously, my discussion was split into 3 points: <br><br>
                                1.   How are design thinking processes impacting the design industry in terms of communication between teams and stakeholders? <br><br>
                                2.   How can young designers adapt better to the design industry with the help of design thinking guides that are less rigid?
                                What are some benefits young designers can get from systematic design thinking guides? <br><br>
                                3. I would like to nudge my take on the subject more towards the systematic side.</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>I actually conducted user interviews with 3 experienced designers last year, around October 2022. It took me longer than expected to transcribe as I was relying on my not-so-good memory to keep track of the key points that they have mentioned and some insights I gathered during the interview itself. But I realised that as time go by, I started to doubt my own memory and question if I took it in the right context. Additionally, the conversation with senior Jiarong who works at Deloitte was over Zoom, I realised after that I had a difficult time focusing and processing all the information he gave me. So I finally gave in and decided to stop procrastinating over this. Finally finished the transcript and was able to categorise them according to key theories and examples they shared. Because of that, I could draw parallels much easier compared to when it was hovering in my mind.</p>

But because I knew I wanted my project to take form from a young designer’s perspective, the questions were focused on the difference between the creative process experienced designers practised themselves and the creative process they teach.</h6>

                                <p>Through the holidays, I’ve spent some time here and there thinking about my research statement. Previously it was to uncover the attributes and characteristics of design thinking from the young designers' perspective who are in UI/UX design. The focus was that from sem 1 as I was hoping to go into the field of UI/UX after graduating from LASALLE. But I slowly discover that it is not realistic for me to do so as it is a niche group of people, but the research should be helpful for young designers in general. Therefore, I took a step back and decide to focus on young graphic designers instead.</p>

                               <p> During the cohort presentation, I was paying attention to how they presented their projects. As the presenters were selected for their good practices, I wanted to learn a few things from them. <br> <br>

                                There were some similarities in the way they presented their projects. One of them is how they constructed a project title that is suitable for their project. They then designed their deck according to that message. Their decks were of a cohesive art direction. It might sound obvious but many of us couldn’t finalise a project title. I can’t speak for everyone, but at least for myself, I waited until the last minute to put a name on my project. I’m still not too sure what the main message of my project would be, therefore I was not confident enough to settle.</p>

It’s obvious in these students’ slides that they have chosen a style to go for, like branding their own project. Previously, I added some rawness in my style with handwritten texts and lines, against a white background. In hindsight, it wasn’t enough.</p>
