                                <br>
                                <p>I actually conducted user interviews with 3 experienced designers last year, around
                                    October 2022. It took me longer than expected to transcribe as I was relying on my
                                    not-so-good memory to keep track of the key points that they have mentioned and some
                                    insights I gathered during the interview itself. But I realised that as time go by,
                                    I started to doubt my own memory and question if I took it in the right context.
                                    Additionally, the conversation with senior Jiarong who works at Deloitte was over
                                    Zoom, I realised after that I had a difficult time focusing and processing all the
                                    information he gave me. So I finally gave in and decided to stop procrastinating
                                    over this. Finally finished the transcript and was able to categorise them according
                                    to key theories and examples they shared. Because of that, I could draw parallels
                                    much easier compared to when it was hovering in my mind.</p>

                                    to take form from a young designer’s perspective, the questions were focused on the
                                    difference between the creative process experienced designers practised themselves
                                    and the creative process they teach.</h6>

                                <p>Through the holidays, I’ve spent some time here and there thinking about my research
                                    statement. Previously it was to uncover the attributes and characteristics of design
                                    thinking from the young designers' perspective who are in UI/UX design. The focus
                                    was that from sem 1 as I was hoping to go into the field of UI/UX after graduating
                                    from LASALLE. But I slowly discover that it is not realistic for me to do so as it
                                    is a niche group of people, but the research should be helpful for young designers
                                    in general. Therefore, I took a step back and decide to focus on young graphic
                                    designers instead.</p>

                                    In this consultation, Joselyn gave me some comments from the formative feedback.
                                    Some changes here and there to make the sentence flow better, and add some
                                    explanations to allow readers to have a better understanding of what the paper is
                                    talking about.

                                    One thing I regretted was not preparing a new copy of the key research inquiry and
                                    research statement for this consultation as I’d already decided to nudge the
                                    research in a slightly different direction, and this research inquiry wasn’t
                                    accurately reflecting the direction I want to move my project towards.
                                </p>
                                <p>Originally, the plan was to conduct user interviews with young designers before Christmas 2022. It dragged on until now and the questions have yet to be vetted and confirmed. I’m starting to panic.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="column__2-5 margin__right-s">
                                <br> <br>
                                <p>Wasn’t until Joselyn asked me about my plan B that I realised that it might not be realistic for me to find willing young designers to sit down and share with me their personal creative process. Joselyn helped me understand that everything should have a backup plan, in case plan A doesn’t work out. One way I could get some sort of materials if the interviews can’t happen, for whatever reason, was to find published interviews online. Ideally, it would be Singapore graphic designers. Another alternative was to look at Asian graphic designers, although it is slightly different from my intended target audience.</p>

A small group of just us who are pretty familiar with each other’s project are updating each other on our progress, at the same time seeking some suggestions for improvement. It feels natural. Therefore, I did not have to prepare much but still manage to bring my idea across.</p>

                                <p>Some of the feedback received was about the ideation sketches. Most agreed that the idea was inspired by Kahoot! would be interesting to adapt to a designer’s version. If I could explain a bit further about the idea, inspired by the multi-screen icebreaker game Kahoot!, I wanted to design something with multiple screens, mimicking a <span class="highlightmered">guided sprint workshop.</span> Where the instructions will be shown on the big screen and the participants can interact with a smaller screen (personal smartphone) to ‘answer’.</p>

                                <p>However, one thing I’m still struggling to figure out is the user flow of the app. As the feedback reminded me that designers are <span class="highlightmered">not friendly with a too systematic process</span>, and that idea would be too mediated for such creative individuals.</p>

                                    <p>This 'game' can help young designers to reflect on their creative process consciously. As it is often intuition for designers to ‘just start designing’. Doing this allows them to look at their creative process as one big picture, and analyse the similarities and differences between their own creative process and their peers.</p>

                                <p>Although it might sound like a fun idea to plan and execute, I don't think it makes sense for this project. The need for a flexible framework is going to be difficult with all the technological constraints. Designing itself consists of many physical items such as sketches, prototypes, and mindmaps. I just can’t see how I can cater for all of those options on the Kahoot! inspired app.</p>
