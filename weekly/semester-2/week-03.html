                                <p>I was inspired by the fortune-telling rock seen in shopping malls in the early 2000s. It analyses your palm and prints out a paper of your fortune. I was always so scared of it when I was younger, perhaps that’s why it left such a deep impression. Through class sharings, it seems like it’s the same for the rest of my classmates who grew up in Singapore.</p> <br>

                                <p>Using the help of sketches, I attempt to find out the possible user flow for the app. One of the variations is a more systematic approach. This might cause inaccurate analysis as <span class="highlightmered"> &nbsp;young designers might be pressured into choosing the ‘correct’ creative process. &nbsp; </span> Another variation slightly solves this issue. It covers the purpose of those steps with applications. As we rely on technological aids in our creative process, I thought that involving them might lessen the pressured feeling from users. Instead of research, it would be Google. Instead of finding inspiration, it would be Behance. And instead of ideation, it would be sketching. Something like that. So far I’m leaning towards the book idea as there is <span class="highlightmered"> &nbsp; a series of deliverable that comes together as a strategy. &nbsp; </span></p> <br>

                                <p>The ideas started to seem too vague and surface-level. It doesn’t feel like it’s something memorable and could be used continuously outside of the grad show or exhibition. The idea was to design something that can remind young designers that they don’t have to do it all themselves. Research has shown that having<span class="highlightmered"> &nbsp; a strong support system has many positive benefits, </span> &nbsp; such as higher levels of well-being, better coping skills, and a longer and healthier life. Studies have also shown that social support can reduce depression and anxiety. A strong support system can often help reduce stress.</p>
