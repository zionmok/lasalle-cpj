How many people consist of a team?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Oh, I thought she asked if we worked together.<br><br>

Zion<br>
Not really you all. Like a creative team or.. <br><br>

Matthew<br>
Outside right<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
A team is like more than 2 people or like 2 people are considered?<br><br>

Zion<br>
2 people also can<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I think I did<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
Yea, everyone have. Confirm have lah right?<br><br>

Zion<br>
How about industry-wise? Have you worked in a team? Does it consist of designers only or outside of  designers as well?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Mixed<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Ya mixed<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
*hums in approval*<br><br>

Zion<br>
Mixed as well? So it’s mixed between designers and non designers?<br><br>

All<br>
Yes<br>

Zion<br>
Okay, great. That answers my question, then I'll start with the first question. Can you share with me the design processes your creative team go through? So the team that you guys were referring to just now. 2 or more people. Maybe we can start with Matthew?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Okay, because I work in different kinds of teams before. So the first one is the design studio kind of team, all designers, and the CD plus you plus 1 more, that kind. So that's one kind of team. The other team, it's a bit of a mix. So is like CD, designer, project manager, kind. So that's another one. Then the last one is a full agency team. So it’s, client service, producer, strategist, designer, tech, product, everything. That's like another kind of team. So which team would you like to know? And then the second part is which part of the process do you want to know?<br><br>

Zion<br>
Maybe just run through with me like, from start to finish. Like the project right, within 1 project, how do you all start and how do you go to the next step? So on and so forth. Do you have a system in place? Or do you just do it intuitively?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Maybe we divide it to the small studio team. A small studio team is more flexible. Because everyone has like a mixed role. So if you’re a designer, you’re also an art project manager, so you have to do your own production. So how that one will flow, is… So you start ideation and everything, so everyone is involved. And then i think, after that, you've got to pitch to the client and all that. And if client feedback is okay, then you got to execute then that's when you break up the role, like who does what. So that one is like really small teams, like maybe 1 designer 2 seniors. During ideation is everyone throw out ideas, quite standard stuff, then once you have a general idea and then you got to start work basically. Then the CDs will approve and all that. So I guess the process is like I do I check and everything, then that one I will also have like, project managing, so I’ll plan the story, work on the timeline, within the team. So I get it done, i approve, i send, i communicate with the team. Then repeat until finish production and talk to printer. Then finish the project and hand over.<br><br>

So then the second one is a medium-sized studio, so maybe 3 designers, 1 CD, project manager. So ideation you still pitch in and contribute. When it comes to the work, you just do the work and hand over to project manager to vet and communicate with clients. Then they come back, then you’ll do the work again, then they’ll pass over. So they kind of serve as that middle person. So you dont have to do outside of your scope, technically as a designer.<br><br>

So the last one, is the agency team. I think that’s abit more complex in structure. But I can’t speak to this definitively as a designer because when I worked in an agency, my role was creative tech. So I don’t know if that counts. Because the role is a bit different from a designer.<br><br>

So let’s say an agency team is client service talks to client, producer talk to us and clients, and they project manage basically. then the strategist will come up with direction, a plan or a strategy. Then there’ll be creative that come up, they’re the designers. So they’ll come up with art direction, copy and everything. If the project require, there will be product designers, they will do UX/UI, user research and all that. Then there’s tech where we come in with feasibility check, implementation, execution. So how I will fit into there is… so is a lot more compartmentalized than the other 2, everyone has their role. Like sort of experts at what they do. So then in the ideation phase maybe I fit in where, strategy comes out with plan. Then they’ll be like ‘is this plan feasible?’. Then I'll be like, ‘okay, sounds doable technically.’ If it’s possible then they’ll tell creatives, okay we have this plan. Then the creatives will do up the plan, art direct and everything. If there’s a website, we’ll get the product designer to do the website, then the product designers will check with me like ‘is this feature on the website doable? Can we test it out?’ then i’ll do a prototype to test that. That’s like the start of the project. After that is like communication, communication, you do it, and you got to communicate across all of them. So like, creative wants something like this, then product wants something like this, then how do you put it together? Then you just do it and hand over. Is really just do your part.<br><br>

Zion<br>
Can clarify the kind of process that you just talk about, did you know that this is the process you want to go through at the very, very start of the project or do you only know at the end?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
It's not expected, but you kind of know what you're getting into.<br><br>

Zion<br>
So every project is around the same?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Yeap.<br><br>

Zion<br>
How about Yu Qi?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I worked in a small team and a big team. So for the small team, i work with the boss. When he gives me the brief I'll just do up the sketches. So just let him know these are my ideas, pitch to him first then he will come back to me and tell me which idea I should continue working on. Afterwards I would develop my ideas, and talk directly to the client. So that's the smaller team. For the bigger team the group of designers don't really see One project through all the way, so we take up different parts of it. so for one project I can start from the beginning and the other project I could start in the middle. for this, I work with different people. So I   work with the creative director and senior designers and copywriters. The base process is still the same, I still sketch up the designs. Except that we will have a vote On which concept is better, everyone joins in on the process.<br><br>

Zion<br>
That's just very very start of the process, after the ideation phase right? After the meeting, how do you continue with the process?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I think is, they split the job. If it was a video job, then they will give it to someone who knows how to do video.  if it was a storyboarding, then storyboarding would do it. but after that everybody splits into their own group And we work with a senior designer. then you go back and forth again.<br><br>

Zion<br>
 the last part is always going back and forth, iterations? how about Vanessa?<br><br>

Vanesssa<br>
Mine is also similar to us but, I myself have never spoken directly do a client before.  so I worked in both a small team and a big team. so the smaller team is just me and the creative director, so we will go ahead with sketches  and Concepts,  then I'll pass it to  creative director and see which one he prefer. then he will pitch all of that to the clients. But I don't get to talk to the client. From then it goes back and forth, what the client wants, I will go according to that. For the bigger team, we also don't see the project to the end.  we are just delegated small parts,  then yeah that's mostly it.<br><br>

Zion<br>
Can you give me one example of part of the project?<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
I think it's mostly just the designing part of it. say They already gave you the concept, what they want for  this project, 'll then you will just design according to what they  want.  the senior  designer will be the one telling you what  they want. so you just, in a way follow. but you will have to pitch idea also, like I think this design works better<br><br>

Zion<br>
So they will do the ideation part and you will do the prototyping part?<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
 Yeah, They will tell you’ I prefer warm colors, don't want cool colors’ Then you will just go from there.<br><br>

Zion<br>
 oh so they will give the art direction.<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
 Yes.<br><br>

Zion<br>
 interesting. so all three of you mention similar things, you start with ideation and go through with iterations and stuff, and you will either communicate with the creative director, your team, and Creative Tech and stuff. how about before ideation,  do you normally get the brief from the client on the creative director or do you have the chance to question the brief and redefine the problem?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 in the smaller team, yes.  in the bigger team, agency, not really,  because how briefs come in and agency setting  is that it will go through client service, Client service will tell strategist, producers. so they will come up with A budget and everything. and then that's is kind of Defined  before it reaches you.  so they would already have broken down the brief, or the problems, found Insights, found the best way forward. so it's up to us take the Information and formulate the design, solution. you can kind of go back and forth with the question, but usually they do a pretty good job figuring things out already.<br><br>

Zion<br>
 so when it comes to you it's pretty clear already?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 yeah. that is the brief, this is what we found out from the brief,  and this is how we should move forward.  will take that and contextualize. <br><br>

Zion<br>
Okay the next question is, what kind of steps and methods do you use as a designer to help me feel creative process? Personally.<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 it differs in the role as a designer, Because I have taken up a few role as a designer. <br><br>

Zion<br>
 so you have the creative tech and?<br><br>

 Matthew<br>
 and just Product designer, and art director. <br><br>

Zion<br>
 maybe we'll just focus on graphic design for now.<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 so the graphic designer one is a lot simpler. Because that was a really small team with the creative directors and it was always just about art Direction and execution. so when the brief comes in, you digest first,  break down the brief and everything,  and I'll just start looking for reference.  because we always start by pitching back to the clients right?  so we don't really do actual work at that phase.  maybe like one KIV mock up.  but everything else we will have to find existing references to sell the idea first.  after you sell it, it's just execution.  maybe we will give them like five references, take two or three to move on. we will develop this to a Elementary stage then they pick one, then we will do iterations on that one, , then we will generate.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I think i start, I am actually guilty of looking at Pinterest.<br><br>

Zion<br>
I mean which designer doesn't, honestly?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
* points to Matthew*<br><br>

Zion<br>
Oh really, which platform do you use?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 it depends also.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
He use books I feel<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 I use books. I use existing printed matters.  so like they will know that I hoard design stuff. I have shelves. is nice, just take  and refer.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
 he has a library, personal Library<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 I have files of reference materials, now I have books, depending on which one will sell the idea, if you have a specific idea then I will try to think of which designer I know of that does similar thing, then I will try to pick up their work.<br><br>

Zion<br>
 that's like having a mental library also<br><br>

Matthew<br>
 if you just want to sell a look and feel and not actual execution then I will draw reference from things outside of design. Like patterns, images and nature, that kind of thing. so it's like a mix, I don't really use Pinterest too much, it's more of Pinterest in my mind.  it's a bit limiting because it's just what I know. But if you keep searching through then you will find more.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I use Pinterest like a normal person. every project I will have a board, so why have I see for  inspiration, I will just put inside.  so the next time I need inspiration for other concepts, When I look again. And then I start sketching and doing out concepts. When you get the brief,  when you are developing the concepts, you don't have to do everything yet, just a few mock ups.  so sketches digitalizing, then develop the collaterals for it.<br><br>

Zion<br>
 from the process you just mentioned, do you go back and forth with your creative director and you for feedback?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Yeah I think from the start, sketch onwards, it's always a back-and-forth thing<br><br>

Zion<br>
Approval or just feedback?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Feedback and discussions. Once the design is digitalised, then he will be like, this is approved or you can work further on this concept, like this concept is approved already.<br><br>

Vannesa<br>
I think working life, I also use Pinterest, but at the site, I like to have a few physical references. But not as many as Matthew. Research I would like, I will not look at books, but I will research online. I will create a mood board from Pinterest or physical stuff that I have found. On the top of my mind, I cannot think of the next step.<br><br>

Zion<br>
After inspiration, what will make you take the next step?<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
When I find research, I try to relate to it emotionally. I try to see how you will relate to others as well, emotionally. Not just things on the surface, if that makes sense.<br><br>

Zion<br>
So you based on your next step on how your audience may feel about your mood board?<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
Yeah. After that I will start doing<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Added to that, it's a bit old-fashioned, we did have a rudimentary version of Pinterest ourselves when we collect references. So what we do is, we will have a folder of images, and we will look at the images and think if, does it look a cohesive look and feel. If it doesn't then we will remove and add until you have a collection of enough images to convince yourself and your clients that this is the look and feel.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
In the big agency that I worked at, they also asked us to do more boards, and then they will review it. Like what he said, to look at it and see if the look and feel fit particular branding. <br><br>

Matthew<br>
Across the folders and decide if they are distinctly different enough or do they collapse into one. So if they collapse into one, they collapse into one. If you realise that within one folder, you have three different styles, then you would want to split them into three.
<br><br>
Zion<br>
Oh it's not your client will be confused right? Like, why would a photo in 2 folder be similar?
<br><br>
Matthew<br>
Yeah but we don't present them the folders. It's just for us to build our mental pictures. 
<br><br>
Zion<br>
Let's move on to the third question. So just now you guys talk about the process your team go through and the process you go through, which stage of the process do you find the most challenging?
<br><br>
Yu Qi<br>
Ideating. Personally, after you do so many projects, there are only so many ideas you can come up with so it gets a bit difficult to develop good concepts for the brief. A cohesive concept will fit the brand well. Sometimes they also don't give you enough information about them, so it's up to you to figure it out or do research. 
<br><br>
Vanessa<br>
I think ideation part also. I guess communicating with clients also. Sometimes when you pitch ideas, some of them are a bit old-fashioned, especially in Singapore. They are not receptive to a lot of ideas that you have as a designer. At the end of the day you have to do what they want instead of what you think is good for them. Sometimes it can get quite stubborn. That's a difficult part of the process also.
<br><br>
Matthew<br>
Contrary to that, I guess there's a difference between small studio set up and an agency. Because if you're in the agency set up, when it reaches ideation, breaking down of the brief is already done for you. They're already insights also, how you should proceed. So that makes ideation a lot simpler. Also about the struggle of selling the idea to the client, they also dependent on how good is the team working on it. It's about how your creative director pitch, it's also how your strategy team sell the strategy. Whether it makes sense to client. That's the luxury compared to a small studio set up when you have to do yourself. As a young designer, as any type of designer even. It's difficult to sell the idea because it counts your experience and eloquence. It could be a great idea but if you sell it very badly…
<br><br>
Zion<br>
So I realise that the process your team go through and what you go through personally it's quite similar. Did you develop this process after you join the team? Or was it in school as well that you follow this kind of process?
<br><br>
Vanessa<br>
I guess it kind of developed from school because that's where you start to build your projects. Lectures tell us not to limit ourselves to just Pinterest or everything on the web. It's good to have a few physical things with you. I think for work you cannot take up too much time to just do research. In school, you can just take your time to do this and that but at work, you cannot.
<br><br>
Zion<br>
Is that what is challenging? Is it because is very fast compared to what you're used to?
<br><br>
Vanessa<br>
Yeah, I'm not experienced enough. Some people can really give out ideas really quickly, but for me, I still struggle with that.
<br><br>
Matthew<br>
It's interesting that you asked if it comes from school or work. Because for me my processes came from school, but it came from lecturers who I eventually work for. So I was already training in that capacity. So when i was in diploma, I have a lecture who owns a studio, so out of school I work for them, so I brought over the processes that they taught me in school. So it kind of came together. When I went to work at another company, the creative director from the previous company went over to the new company also, so the processes was brought over as well.
<br>
Zion<br>
So it's following the person, your mentor?
<br>
Matthew<br>
Yes I guess. But where it differs is when in an agency setting, with the big team set up , everyone has different roles, everyone does what they do, I think that's what school doesn't really prepare you for. When you're one piece in the big team, you just only do your thing in the whole process. As much as you want to involve in breaking down the brief, more often than not you are not involved. That is done at a higher level, as a strategist or creative director. So you have to figure out what's your place, figure out how to function. Essentially you do less work, but it's also confusing that you do less work, because things are handed down to you, are you might not know how to take them. 
<br>
Zion<br>
Yeah because in school one project is from start to finish right?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Yeah, you also need to know how to hand it off. Let's say you need to switch off, you need to know how to hand off the project to another person. Because not everyone knows how to have things ready for production, let's say is a designer's work, how to FA (final artwork) properly, before you hand it to your senior designer to sign off, or for your producer to manage production. So that's the kind of thing you pick up at work instead of school. <br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I think my processes are mostly from school. I think when we study in Poly, they already taught us a fixed set of things we should do. For example user experience, you have to collect insights, and certain things stay the same as they are taught to me. So when I encounter similar projects, I use the same processes. I want to start to go to different companies, you also adapt to their design processes. It's a mixture.<br><br>

Zion<br>
You mention that in poly they thought you certain processes, can you share with me what are these processes?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
from what I can remember, for example it's a branding project, they always give us a template, SWOT analysis is one, then for the final design they always ask us to provide a rationale. When you do your p board. I remember when I first came to uni, when we have group project, nobody will start doing p board, condensing everything into a one-page document, then I will be wondering what is everyone doing? Why are we doing so many different things that doesn't feel cohesive? You will feel very out of place, but you will have to switch and adapt.<br><br>

Zion<br>
You guys mention that in a big team, you only be involved in a small part of the project. Can you share with me what kind of part do you usually get as a young graphic designer?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I feel is the very start or the very end. Very start will be ideation concepts and sketches, when nothing is confirmed. They will just give you a brief and tell you this is what you need to do, and you need to sketch out the ideas. The very end is when they already did all part of the design, and the design is decided, then you create other collaterals. <br><br>

Vanessa<br>
I agree, it's either the very start or the very end. The start ideation and at the end would be the time when you have to send in the FA. When you have to pass everything to your superior for them to check and confirm to send your boss for confirmation, basically that<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Is definitely those two things, it depends on your timeline, the client, and depends on whether they will let you do it. The most obvious thing they will ask you to do is adapt. They will tell you that the design is set, then you just adapt 30 different collaterals. Basically is just switch off and just do, copy paste and resize. Maybe when a project gives you more flexibility, maybe they will ask you if you want to take the ideation, or when they trust you more and let you do the front side of it. Maybe if they just want to give you exposure, they probably won't take your idea most of the time, but they were just ask you to try. I had time is where I have to sign off myself, and also sometimes when I have to get approval, so that's a mix. Also depends on how much they trust you at that point of time. Sometimes I can just sign, go, straight to printer. But sometimes I will have to get them to doublecheck. It really depends on how much trust and faith to have on you to the point of time. Definitely also about how big the project is. If you are going to print 1 million copies, you will have to get someone to see, sign off. This kind of decisions are always made above us. You can gauge for yourself if this is super risky, 500 page 5 page brochure. Maybe about who is the client. Maybe they will ask you to sign off if you think you can handle yourself. They will tell you to take it true. Or if they feel that the project is very important, maybe 600 pages, you ask you to ask them to sign off for you. Yes it comes down to the project and the level of trust, and your capability. If you are damn blur, no one is going to like you to sign off on anything. But if you show that you are capable, they will let you do it. But there is only applicable for smaller places. Bigger places is, they have people for that. So you will need to know how to hand over.<br><br>

Zion<br>
How often do you see other designers processes?<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Not often.<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
For me I have never seen it before. <br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I don't have either.<br><br>

Matthew<br>
When you say process, do you mean watch them work?<br><br>

Zion<br>
Depends maybe if you are curious about how do you get from point a to point B, maybe you go and find their documentation or portfolio or videos on social media.<br><br>

Matthew<br>
So you are talking about people who you don't know?<br><br>

Zion<br>
Maybe both<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
Is it the people that I don't know, I have seen before.<br><br>

Matthew<br>
I have never seen the strangest process before. Because I only look at books. I don't have tiktok. But sometimes I will ask them, and they will tell me that they started here and ended up here. Let's say you work with a senior designer, they will open the documentation and show you the first version, because of something, it became this and it became that. <br><br>

Zion<br>
next question is, if you can imagine something that can allow you to know more and work more efficiently, what would that be?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
This might be a bit detrimental but really it's experience. I can watch other peoples process, but if I can't do it or it doesn't gel with me, I can't use it. Because I think everyone is a little bit different. Even when we search for things will be a bit different. I mean, it will be great to have a resource, steps to do the steps to do that, how do people do this and that, and you can match what will work with yours, your own process. But it is really up to experience on how fast you can do. <br><br>

Zion<br>
How about other peoples experience?<br><br>

Other peoples experience you can learn from but if you can't do it then wont work also. It definitely helps the watch and learn from other people, but can I do it? The more you do the better you get. If you want to talk about doing design work fast, if you already know how to do it then you will be fast, if you know all the shortcuts the do things, then it will be even faster. But if you do it 10 times, then it will be common knowledge.<br><br>

Zion<br>
How about the rest, you can even talk about robot so AI<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
AI, that's a bit much<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Actually can work. There is ChatGPT<br><br>

Matthew<br>
If you want to visualise art direction, you can just throw in text in to chatGPT or DALL-E. It would just throw out images. That's definitely efficiency.<br><br>

Zion<br>
Maybe I can rephrase the question a bit, just now you all mention that the ideation part can be the most challenging part of the design process, so have you ever felt that if something is implemented you can help you with that challenge?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
I can't speak for ideation, but for adaptation or branding , then you would be having a library of guidelines. You will know what is needed,. Maybe possible touch points, then you can just fill in. If you talk about UI, maybe design system out there, then you will know what components is needed. Definitely having a library of reference is good, itwill make everything faster. I have a book that tells me print dimension, I can just refer to it. <br><br>

Vanessa<br>
But all this kind of things it takes time to collect. It's not on the spot we can do effectively. It takes time to gather.<br><br>

Matthew<br>
But once you have that, you will be simpler to know what components is needed when you want to do a branding project. <br><br>

Zion<br>
Basically what you are referring to is having experience?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Yes having experience is one thing, but for someone who is new, having a library of resources, instead of them questioning what do they need.<br><br>

Zion<br>
Do you think this kind of resources, is your own responsibility as a young designer to gather, or would you want the brand to provide for you?<br><br>

Matthew<br>
But the thing is client do not always know what they want. It's up to you to collate the references, but also collectively designer share, but not everyone wants to share.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I feel like my problem is when I want to find something but I cannot find. I can't envision it but I just don't know what to find. When I search online I have to go through multiple articles before I get the one that is useful. <br><br>

Matthew<br>
So that is what a reference library is for. But if you have a list of components, you can look up, you already have everything and you just find. For example if you do P5JS, you can look at the library/documentation. Or maybe you can do a design system where you can have all the components examples buttons, different kinds of buttons. The reason like a definite guide.<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
I have a very small thing, it might sound like the obvious thing to a lot of designer. If you was to work more efficiently right, when we were in school, we use software. Normally when i use illustrator, I will be looking for stuff, where is this stuff where is that stuff, so how you set up your own software. Because I didn't really know about all this kind of stuff until I met Matthew. I realise that when I really start to set up my own workspace for software, I realise that I can manoeuvre around very fast. Because in school we just take our own time, but at work we cannot. At what we do a lot of saikang, like the application and stuff, actually kind of stuff is really very important but many people don't realise it. <br><br>

Zion<br>
Okay so Yu Qi one is about being able to find something easily.<br><br>

Matthew<br>
Yeah like not sitting through a 30 minutes YouTube video.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Yeah, not having to check on the website of "top 10 best website "and you will have to scroll and scroll<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
I actually agree about Vanessa say about the workspace<br>

Matthew<br>
You should learn the keyboard shortcut as well. Like if you ask me the keys, I wont to remember, but if you give me the keyboard I can press it. It becomes muscle memory and you will really be fast.<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
Basically is knowing the basic knowledge of the program<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
No basic knowledge is different from commands<br><br>

Yu Qi<br>
But in a way it's still helps, for example paragraphing styles. Page number, so when I was working, they will ask where is your style.<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
Yeah everything you will have to do properly. Even in Illustrator, in school you will just do, you don't care right, but you will need to layer and name the layer at work. Everything must be in place. <br><br>

Matthew<br>
You will have to know how to name your files properly. Like 01 02. The right folder within the product folder, and depends on the workplace you are working as well. Some places you can just send a files over with telegram, but some places theyyou have a specific sharing folder with everybody's name. <br><br>

Zion<br>
I have a A few extra questions, do you think it's important for everyone in the team to have the same design process<br><br>

Matthew<br>
I think as long as everyone has the same goal and objective, how you get that is not important. <br><br>

Zion<br>
Just now we talk about we don't really see design processes of other designers, why do you think so?<br><br>

Vanessa<br>
Actually I have never come across a senior designer who are very secretive with their process, it's only in school where the environment is competitive. They will share if you ask<br><br>

Matthew<br>
It's a better world out there<br><br>
