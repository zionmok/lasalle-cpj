                                <p>From the insights gathered from user interviews with the young designers, some changes have been made to the discussion points.</p>

                                <p>Previously, it was primarily to find out how will a flexible design process benefit young designers and their teams. It has a very clear stand on the non-systematic design process, but it seems like it’s pretty obvious at this point in time. What I should focus on is the actual design process young designers go through in the current context. And to that, I can’t make any assumptions yet.</p>

                                <p>Although I’m clear on what are the points I want to discuss, I did not know how to categorise them into themes that make sense. So I started typing from memory what kind of conclusion I want to have, hoping to get some kind of common theme from it.</p>

                                <p>From the previous cohort presentation, I realised that having a good art direction can really make the whole project look composed. But it’s been very difficult for me to choose the art direction as my mind changes every time I see my slides. So I wanted to focus on trying and settling on an art direction.</p>
                                <p>As the project is about different types of graphic designers with different creative processes, I wanted to play with multiple colours, representing the many creative processes that exist in Singapore but still manage to work together seamlessly like a rainbow.</p>
                                <p>As round table, open studio and presentations are all nearing, I wanted to make something interactive that I can show to let my audience get a rough idea about my project in a fun way. Therefore I wanted to do up a tiktok filter that will show you the creative process types as an entertaining way to encourage designers to consciously think about their creative process. So I started researching for designs that popular tiktok filter users enjoy. Found out that a tarot card filter is actually pretty similar to what I want to do. So I decided to take a reference for that.</p>

                                <p>Exploring the combination of multiple typefaces to show the different creative processes that exist together harmoniously. </p>
                                <p>It was difficult to combine typefaces of different styles and weights, while still ensuring that the overall word looks visually balanced and appealing. So I tried multiple combinations while keeping in mind to make sure the letters should look rather different from each other, obvious enough to tell that they are from different typefaces, but also gel well together that one might not immediately be able to tell there’s something unusual with it.</p>

                                <p>Besides having combination typefaces, I wanted to include a mixture of colours to further emphasize on the different types of creative processes. Starting with primary colours, I branched out to secondary colours with the shade. And on top of that, I added a few more colours that I liked and thought would be a pop of colour for the selection. From that, there are a total of 8 colours currently.</p>
                                <p>After applying it to the text, it seems lively but might be too much to look at, causing confusion and repulsion. So I reduced it to 4 colours that I liked. I tried applying the colours to the letters in sequence at first, looping it every time it was all used up. It seems okay until I had to create a variation of the text.</p>

                                <p>I started to question if this could be a logo for my project. So I decided to experiment with the sizing and see how it would look in different sizes. It might not be the final name of my project but I just wanted to try playing with the idea of having a combination of typeface and colours as the main logo/icon.</p>
                                <p>In 100px(H) and 50px(H), it was getting difficult to see the letters, making it difficult to read. Therefore I experimented with picking out certain letters and piecing them together.</p>

                                <p>Afterwards, I adjusted the leading manually to make it look cohesive. Then, I took a step back and look at ‘DiPa’ as a shape, not just letters. Then I realised that the letter ‘P’ doesn’t really gel well with the letters around it. I tried to make part of ‘A’ loop through ‘P’, hoping it will look like a family. But now the ‘i’ looks really squished between the letters ‘D’ and ‘P’. I attempted to give it more breathing space by increasing the kerning. However, the spacing is now unbalanced. Finally, I sheared the letter ‘P’ to look like the italics of ‘i’. It works!</p>
