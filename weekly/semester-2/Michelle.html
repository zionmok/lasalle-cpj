                                    Okay, let's start the interview.
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    You wat me to introduce myself first?
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Yes, can you introduce yourself, maybe your name and how many years of experience you have working in a team? And also what's your role in the teams that you have worked with?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Hi, I'm Michelle. I've been working as a product designer for about nine months at Frog. I work in a team consisting of two roles. The first would be as the UI/UX lead. So what that means is basically, I feel like apps or services, products, I mean, with Figma. And usually, I will also have some recommendations and how to make the experience better from the user standpoint, and the second role would be more on the selling side where I also educate stakeholders, as well as other teammates such as BA (business analysts) and, developers as well on what's the importance of UX, and how we apply it to make things better. So that's is what I do.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Thank you for the introduction. May we can start with the first question. When you're working in a team, can you share with me your design processes, you and your team go through.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Okay, to start off, our team, we are relatively newly established. So we don't have like, standard design ops or a standard a SOP. So like, we don't have a concrete standard workflow, we go by if you work in a team, let's say in like OGP (open government projects), where they already have an established team, and they have a lot of designers. So even at Grab where they have I think, 100, or like hundreds of designers, they will have a more formal process. But for us generally, first thing we do, when we sit down is to define the business scope. that is because we are in like tech over in consulting, so we tend to focus on the business problems more than human problems and social problems, so more business problems. So first we define the scope. And so we will get the scope from the business analyst or if there has already been work done beforehand. So like the existing design, which is usually the case for us because there are like design systems in place already and policies to follow, then we will kind of also have to request for any documentation, there's like a document for the things that we have to deliver, as per our contract. Yeah, so we start from there first, but from a user standpoint, we will kind of check through any prior research done. And try to understand that let’s say, in the context, so there was this project, we worked on where it was from MOM. So it's for the executives, they want to know how to reduce workplace injuries. So we will try to think from the standpoint from an executive,  what are the few things I need to do.   So what's their workflow, their user journey? And what are their pain points? So those are things we will try to understand first, so that we know in what areas do we make recommendations? Or are we more looking at like UI reskin, which is more visual and trying to make it more intuitive. It sounds like a lot but it's just a rough guage.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    This is the research phase right? How about after the research phase?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    After the research is where the designers get together. At first, because we were acquired by the consulting firm, there was only one designer per project. But I do know that in like a regular design team, you will definitely have like the lead, and then maybe like a junior or something. So each of you will have different roles to play. In my case, once I understood what needed to be done in the context of the MOM project, then it was also looking at what are the current design patterns. Because that will show me like, what's the patterns that the users are used to seeing already, because every time we introduce a new design, we do have to take what's the mental workload for the users to pick up this new habit? Is it very inconvenient, or like, we also have to take note that the changes we make are consistent throughout all the pages. So an example of that would be, let's say, our back to top about them, as always be in the same placement and the same type of movement so that we keep the experience consistent and predictable for them, but at the same time we improve it. Yeah. So that's what we'll do, then our look at some references, compile some of these things. And because the project was relatively fast, where every week, we will meet the stakeholders once or twice, so we would quickly get out like, what they call like an MVP (minimum variable product) that basically means, like, a very quick way of framework or draft just to show them that okay, this idea. Then we'll present that in a meeting and say, Okay, this, this solution that we've come up with, because of this this this reasons, the rationale, and then we kind of touch base to see whether that is in line with their internal design team, because they have an in house team too. And what are the technical and business constraints. So usually that comes to like cost and for their tech team to implement it, will it take a lot of time? or do they have a team working on it? Yeah, so that will  be the second step. But I do think that's very different from if you were working in like a design research oriented team. But they were more likely to go into the softer parts, like, more focus on the users discovering like deeper insights. It's really more business design as they say. Usually, for government, they will have some back and forth, they love it. Even outside of government, you will usually get some feedback, because in such a short timeframe, it's very rare for you to be able to fully understand it unless you have a lot of experience. And a lot of us had like two or three years of experience working as a product designer. So I would say we still have room to grow. But we just do what we can, they will send in feedback from upper management and stuff like that. So we'll look at it and we'll say like, how do we come up, we like balance our stakeholders needs with our end user, which are our executives. so that we can still create, like, consistent and like, not irritating experience. Because what happened was, why they reached out to us was because they wanted to turn the manual processes, whether it be from the interface level, so that is where we come in, UI/UX on the website, and also on the backend as well. So how they get the data is still a request from the database or whatever. And then because it was manual, so every time somebody asked for data, they had to send in a request. So that's add loads from the server. So this is from business standpoint, they want to minimise all these security risks as well. Yeah, so but at the same time, the users were also having issues finding things because it was so manual. So they took like many clicks to just click click and then find that thing. And then when they want to start something then they had to start from scratch and I think this usually introduces a lot of like friction in the website. And in this case, the friction is not good. Sometimes having friction is good example when you do like PayLah, when you transfer, they got the animation, that’s actually on purpose. The transfer is actually instant but people don't feel secure or like ‘did i transfer?’ so they introduced this to make you feel like oh. So that’s friction, it’s also loading. But in this case, it's not good, because people feel like very leichek (troublesome) so we have to balance that. But also a lot of constraints, so what we eventually settled down was simply to keep it within the service, because what they like to do is to merge everything together. But it's very hard, because sometimes people don't even use it. So it's a lot of clutter. So we suggested to take out the services that the execs do not need to use, and really focus on… we create the dashboard, so governments and banks love dashboards. We created a dashboard so that at a glance, they can gather a lot insights. Then only when you need to take action. Then below that you want to call a CTA or call to action button, where you can click in and then go in and do whatever edits.. So it reduces the need to go back and forth between pages. Yeah, so that was what we proposed. And this actually kind of towards the end, I will say, but it goes pretty fast for us, because we cannot present something very raw to the clients on their end, because they're like, Oh, what is this? Huh i pay you so much then you give me black and white. So the wireframe that we refer to usually just means like a draft, but it's more or less complete. And then it's usually like interactive prototype where you won't have all the animations, but it should be enough for them to go through on their side to understand which website links to where. So yeah, that is our process, they have a lot of back and forth within the stakeholder management.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Usually we will propose and I will do like a mock up. But the final product may look different. It's really up to their in-house team, because we're not the ones implementing. So that is the different part within an in-house team, or, let's say, much more design-focused team.<br><br>
                                    
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    That the process the whole team goes through right? how about you as a designer, what kind of steps or methods do you have?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    in terms of using design thinking to solve problems?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Any kind. day to day in your work life. let's say from a project from start to finish, or your role in that project, right? What is the process like in that project?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Okay, for me, personally, my process in a project. Usually your sheet first, I will of take note whether I can do, this very important, because at the start, if I should require any resources, or if I feel like it will take much more time than we have proposed, I have to sound out to the project manager for that. So either ask, now, I have to know what I need to ask already. So for example, if I don't think I have enough time, so I may have to ask, is there anyone that could help me with this particular work? So that I can focus on my expertise. And second is also, let's see, I look at scope and I think that it doesn't really quite make sense, then it's up to me to make sense of them and to let them know that , what was the rationale behind this, so that I can know, and that is important for it. The decisions I take after that will really heavy reliance on that, the so called problem statement. Yeah. So I think that's more or less the flow from why I recall. is not too different from the design team design thinking process. Personally, maybe I might even consider some, what we call housekeeping where I will write down documentation. So for every change or iterations, alright, how many it is, so that the clients will also know that, this is the let's say, like, 18 iterations, so that you know that we spend quite a bit of time in this because there can be so many layers, that you're not always talking to the same people and they have their own things to do. So keep up with that the date and then also in The reasons behind why we've made certain things. So then, if I were to hand over to someone else, they will understand why we make all these things in the first place. it's not because I want to make bad design, there was reason for this. You also can check, because there's too many like, decisions and changes to keep track of after time. I often forget about what I make, then i will be like ‘why was this here again?’ Oh, yeah. So we do work with a researcher. In a consulting firm, the researcher does all the interviews as well. So the client in this project, gave us a focus group, like a list. And then they were sort out the people who are one, interested and also qualified to give this. So they've used this for like, three, four years kind of thing. So there'll be criteria we set out in our design, the research plan. Yeah. So so we'll also do our own internal research. And using the insights we got them from research. That is what will drives our design decisions as well. And that is what will include ppt. Yeah, so we're always present using a PowerPoint. Yeah. So I do work with researcher. Aside from interviews, I will say even for the UI, and UX i worked at also. So let's say I make some changes, or I do some suggestions, I'll ask them, do you think the work flow makes sense from your point because there'll be more familiar with the users profile, or behaviours, because that is what they will spend most time gathering. I'll be for my role, I focus more on UI. But I know that people who do more UX as well, might also see visual improvements. Yeah, which also has UX, but it's just in a different context. Yeah. So business UX will be like, looking at matrix or KPI, then you go do your what they call AI (information architecture). So you sort out and recategorised like, should this be here, how people navigate? Should this even be here? Or should we just remove this things? That will be more UX? But the type of thinking behind UI more like, should I even put a button? Or should I just put a hyperlink? Because in the system it says this this this… this kind of thing. Yeah. So I will say that is my role. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    After all, this kind of rationale and design is more or less just variations? After iterations, is there anything inbetween iterations and end product?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Oh, yes, a lot. There's also more iteration. And then there's also research, actually, because our design thinking process is not always linear. So they do go back and forth between stages let’s say, Should we somehow ..it is annoying, but there are times we find out about new insights or new constraints that we were not informed prior, then we have to go back and check with people or try with the data that we have, again to say like, Okay, is it still valid? Is it still accurate? Because we went ahead with the research plan with these assumptions. So is this still true? If not, then we will wonder like, do we have enough time to go and interview again? Or how should we manage this type of risk. and then we usually have to voice out the sort of changes as well to the stakeholders. Yeah, but the project manager will also kind of, in our case, it was a business analyst taking that role. So they will keep track of the timeline. And they will also manage expectations in a way because usually, this person has worked with the client for a while. So they will know roughly based on their experience, what the client needs. Yeah. Because on our side consulting, we don't always stay on one project throughout the whole thing. Whereas I think in-house or in design teams, you will be staying with one service or what they call like vertical, throughout the whole phase, from like, that conceptualization to designing the implementation and then even working with the developers. We don't really do that. We do have hand off to developers and we do work with them to make it consistent, but it's not that deep. Yeah, it's more like okay, okay, it looks okay already, then just give them more than they will take over. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    So you guys do more of the initial part, you guys are the catalyst for the project?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Yeah, correct. So we are doing so called ‘high level stuff’ where we just want to see whether this concept is working and possible to make. Consulting, we'll do more concepts. I heard from my friend, who intern at Grabthat is really looking at more UX. So they will think about even a copyright thing and say that is, how is this confusing? Or like, they, they have a lot of data to back up. So they say, the churn rate churn rate is like when people drop off, then they don't come back. Yeah, like retention rate will be whether they stay on how long? So they have all this data to say that to wonder that, okay, let's say the retention rate here is very low. How, how might we improve this? Or what is causing them to drop off? Is it like a price? Is this copywriting? Is it the button placement? Or is this just how does it make them feel? So they will go and do. So I will say that is much more design and engineering focused<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    So different between grab and frog is that they have like their own data whereas you guys are presented with problems from this stakeholders?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Yeah, right. We are usually working on suggestions, trying to see if there's an opportunity to solve something or make it better. Whereas for them, because they have access to all that data, it's usually they know that there is problem. If let's say ours is more like a big picture level, theirs is just a small looking at the details and like each and every interaction? Because they got a lot of people, they have hundreds of people in just deign. For us we don't have so we just agar agar general idea of it, concept.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    From all the design process that you've mentioned, your own personal one, which stage of it, you find the most challenging?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    think, maybe for me, because I don't have a lot of background in software development,  I'm still trying to understand how you think and how they retrieve your data. I will say something I face a lot is where I suggest design solutions. But they might not actually be well thought of, from a developer's point of view, where I might be one, introducing a new pattern, or maybe even small details like copy required to retrieve data from different database. Yes. So this increases the load. So that is something I'm still trying to understand. So tech constraints. Later we go design some funny funny thing, then developer like, this cant be done.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    The tech constraint will affect your design decisions?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Yes. Because like in product design, ultimately, it's a product. So if you can't implement it, you cannot create, then your suggesting for nothing. So sometimes you see a lot of cool UI, which is really cool on Dribble and stuff, but actually is not feasible. I will say it's not realistic in the sense where it's very rare for companies UI, or web sites their touchpoints to look as cool as that is very rare. Usually you will have in like the really established companies at Apple, where they really want to be like, innovative pioneer. It's very rare to see other government, not to shit on govtech, but you;hh have a vibe that it is very corporate.. Yeah. Trying to make it more fun with illustrations. it does work.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    But it put constraints on the back end stuff right?
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Yeah, right. So all these things have to take note of. So usually what they will do, they want to reuse assets. Let's say, on page one, on the home page, let's say I say, I want this new banner, let's say, but in the rest of the pages, I never use this banner at all. So they will say, don't use, think of some other way to achieve the same function. Because why Why spend time building this when we don't use it? it's also to make sure that they don't have to keep updating the website.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Platforms like Shopee does have a singular banner on the homepage?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    It’s different for ecommerce because the updates are very frequently, they need to keep up with the trends. So something that is kind of happening within the industry is where people kind of just, and then they will copy the patterns because it works already, if somebody's doing it means is producing business results, profits.So they just take, also no copyright. If you have heard of the apple dynamic Island, because this new OS update, after two days or something, I think Huawei or something just came out with. Yeah, I think that designers for them overworked, they just implemented it within two days. People do prioritise business more over than coming up with something new. That is also a risk. Like, what if you you spend so much time on it, then the users find it useless?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    So just now you mentioned in Frog, the process is more broad because there’s so many people, business side, developers, stakeholders, but for you also use work with this kind of people on your own, Developer and the stakeholders and such. Is this process developed from your company? Or was it something you practice way before?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    It's a bit of both. A lot of it I learned from uni, where I was quite lucky to be exposed to this really cool, like research consultant from Australia. He came down to give a talk.I thought, the way he draws insights are really cool. I never thought of it that way. But of course, he is super experienced. So that was what started me to kind of think like, what is the better way to frame this or to use that better statements to kind of, make the solutions more out there and more emotional in a way that still works? But I would definitely say I was also influenced by the culture at Frog where the first thing I’ll ask is what's kind of the SOP Or what's the way of working, WOW? Is there like a resource library we have? So if people have like design system library, you take the components. we also have our own branding. So anything that we present to the client has to have the so called Frog branding? Yeah, using all the fonts and everything, and they have like PowerPoint templates also. So I will say is a bit of a mix. And also I, however lucky to have very nice seniors. So they also teach me a bit, so I will say maybe it's like design thinking is like iteration everywhere. He just combined me yeah, just see what works better then if it doesn't work. I will always be open to new ways of thinking.<br><br>
                                    
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    You mentioned that there's only like, one designer per project, right? In different projects with different designers, do you think you guys have the same process?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    I don't think so. So there was one time my senior went to reservist, so I had to take over his work for a bit because there was some changes and the way he set up the files even was very different. Then I had to understand why such changes made. To think of an example would be, I think I tend to think of more like, the users or even like, what type of behaviours they will have, what kind of interactions. However, for my senior, I think it would focus more on like, the layout, the colours or like the placements. And how will you make it so that it looks good also. But this particular senior has a very long background in visual comms where he was working in agencies for about seven or eight years. So that is his forte. Yeah, so there are differences.. Whereas I have another senior doing like bank banking projects, where it's more of UX and understanding other systems and transactions kind of things, that it's very different the way they think. So the senior working in a bank will consider more business constraints where like, Is this more cost? How are we going to present? He won't focus so much on innovation, because there is not what a bank is. Bank needs consistency and trust and security. Whereas other projects, I think they did some FnB things, you can always explore more that because they have less concern about leaking confidential data. So it's very different. Sometimes people are abit rigid, not to say that theyre bad. So we kind of check each other. So there'll be times where my researcher, listen too much stuff from the stakeholders, then they're confused already, then they'll suggest that, Oh, can we do this and say, like, they put a hyperlink beside the file, then I will have to kind of so in a table, then they will say, I'll put this in this row, because they want to have some function there. Now I will  say, actually, it doesn't make sense. Because this row has this logic, that we put it there, I think you will be confusing because people think the hyperlink is catered to that person's name. So it's that person's file, instead of like a general landing page. So then we're Oh, yeah, that's true. So we check against each other. I think it is very hard to work alone. because you have someone to bounce ideas off, then you kind of stuck in your own bubble. it is hard to check whether or not are you making the best move? Or are you just doing according to your own style.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    You mentioned you and the researchers check each other. Maybe you and your design colleagues also maybe talk over lunch or something. So how often actually, do you see processes or designers outside of your workplace?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Not often. Unless that say I want to go for those meetups or even just among my own circles. So I know like designers that we kind of chit chat. I also have a friend he likes to just ask me for advice or like test out prototypes kind of thing without other confidential data. So we do exchange our own, like feedbacks and like thought process of like, oh, like, why do you do this? Or like, Oh, I think you do this is quite good. Because that …. So yeah, we do bounce ideas off. I learned new things a lot. So because everyone has different specialties, for me, it was to be a visual designer or UI. But let's say, a friend of mine has like front end development experience, so he'll be able to tell me about those designs are feasible or not. So he will say like, from back end, this is how it will work. So that's how I learned.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    So it's like through like friends meet ups, then you will just be talking?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    I would say so. I do know the companies to kind of have like the small workshop together with other teams. Then that is where you know how the culture like, how do they work? So that's always very insightful in a good way. I think it's very important because for this MOM project, it only started with two to three pages. And then with all the interactions, everything, I try to keep track of like, close to 50 screens. And that's very little already. On apps, I think it can balloon up overnight, you just be scrolling and it all looks almost the same, just a bit of colour difference, or because you have to show all the different states. Let’s say this button, when I click, it looks like this, when I hover, it looks like this, when it’s deselected it will look like that. So all of these right is sort of like a language. All of these buttons are these, hyperlink colours must be related. Cannot be one button’s default state is  orange, then my hyperlinks, I put purple, does it match? In the case of a dashboard, it also has to go anything that is interactive. They call it semantics, how people naturally feel things.For example traffic lights, red means stop, green means go. So lets say, you use all these colours in your design, then does it make them feel anxious? Or does it make sense? So I think we have a case where we almost put actually, it was a good thing. But more numbers means good, but then we put red,but it makes them feel that it’s an error. So we have to change that. So these are considerations. I think learn as you go, I google a lot. If it doesn’t work then you’ll learn. I google a lot, at the start of the project, there are so many things like that. So there are a lot of resources like an NNG or like, you can just Google like UX stuff. Then in iOS, you can check out those Apple material guidelines. That’s the base model that you need to take notes because they will put it in the app store. If not it’ll be very weird. One app it follows this, in another app the alignment different. Sometimes people don’t understand. I have people tell me to use semantics colours. But if everything is in red and green, wouldn’t it be very ugly? I know the colours don't matter as much, but it was very bad. Yeah. Then I don't think I don't want to use it. Then how? It’s a balance. Yeah. So every because it's quite a soft skill. So there's no hard and fast rule as comapred to development. it works and it doesn’t work. But design is like you just have to test. You will have opinions from everywhere then because it's visual. So I will say there is kind of a stigma where they're like oh, design so easy, click button I also know how to do. You’ll get opinions from everywhere. That is where I tell myself to be patient, let them know what's going through my process so that they can understand, then we can see whether we can reach some kind of common ground but annoying, yes, very annoying. Don’t ask me to use  super black against white background, and we never use the black anywhere, so it doesn’t make sense. But they’ll say like ‘we suggested to client already’ then okay lor, because it’ll bad if we as a company suggest this, then the next say i say ‘actually it’s a bad idea.’ Then clients will feel ‘do you even know what you’re doing?’ So yeah, that'd be my own personal process.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Okay, so if I can just ask you to imagine something, anything that could help with, with your process, for you to work more effectively and efficiently, what would that something be?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Depends on the problem. But in the case of the problems I listed before, which is mostly complication, then maybe, make it easier to take note of, all the documentations, or even like, less effort to keep all this system because that is how people lose track. They are so busy already that they miss out all these details.. So like, a way for people to look at, compare all their designs or what, at a glance, like a shared space. but it could even be a group activity even, where here and there we would have stand ups, we just all come in and share what we have done. Which is something we do already. But sometimes we busy then we’ll be like ‘It's fine, we don’t have any important updates.’ So we'll share our screen, then we kind of learn from each other. We do do our own works sometimes, but I don't really encourage you. what we were trying to do at one point was, as a whole team, then we split into groups, then we try to do like a challenge where we define our own briefs. We can also look at, like the current sectors that the company wants to move towards, or try to have more business from. So that's why they call BD, business development. So that at least you do it for your portfolio, but you can kind of feel like it's not completely imaginary. Yeah. Maybe also something I will say, if there's anything it has to either while working in first or working designer, or installing something that is quick to do, doesn't require too much effort in one day. It could be like multiple, like increments, to complete the whole thing, but it cannot like one day require six hours.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    How do you do documentation currently?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    For now, I just pu a note beside the changes on Figma. Actually it would be quite cool if,  Because nowadays they use Slack, it's like those task management apps, it'd be really cool if there was like, some ways to make it more fun to like, maybe in a click of a button, then people can just join in to my screen and they can interact or faster way or more fun ways to provide updates. Because sometimes it's really it’s very sian. thankfully, I've been people are very nice, so I dont feel so sian. But  I do think how to coorporate. Oh my friend had a lot of issues in meetings where there were so many meetings, so if there was some way to provide quick snapshots or what updates you dobefore so that we reduce the amount of meetings, then I think we can communicate. I feel like you know, there's always share butter, but I’m wondering what else could help us efficient thing. actually, I think it's already quite efficient, but it's just it feel if there can be an extra thing. It feels like an extra work.I feel like not doing, then sometimes you do miss out stuff that I should have done. It could even be like templates, but I think if you're trying to make something cool for portfolio, it’s nothing, so I’m trying to think of new ideas.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Maybe just now you mentioned communication, right? Something that can streamline communications within teams?<br><br>
                                    
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    So maybe with that, you might have to consider access controls also. So let's say I will not want to give my business analyst edit permissions. Or I may want to restrict certain things that you can see, maybe some plugins.So yeah, there will be layers of it. Efficiency come from me doing my work one, second will be communicating with people,. And then, but this could even be a space, physical space kind of thing. I have no idea. So yeah, could be like, interior design. It's more like interior design. They have like whiteboards. When you meet just go there, write, so some whitebaord challenge.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    This kind of challenge is it for team communication?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Team communication and also with clients. So it's a very fast way to just work out ideas so that you don't spend so much time on something that's not, yeah, but then very, like working working. I think it's personal stuff, then I would prefer it to be more fun, because I already feel very sian to design. But I like design, but it’s work. maybe there's some way not to do my work faster, b ut make it so that they call screens or bite sizes, so it doesn’t feel like work. but also have some way make it per session ow what.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    My last question is for you to show me what would help improve our design process, but I think you're the answer with the previous question.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    I woud definitely say more experience, it could be some resources, or it could be like a community. But I think they have communities on Discord already. Like you meet design people and like  ‘Hello, hello, I work from where where where…’ then yall just chitchat. That’s quite cool<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    Actually can  you tell me more about this community? Because I’m thinking of doing some sort of support system for young designers.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Okay, they have one from what I know. But I'm not very active on that, they have one that is called Friends of Figma. So all the designers will joined and then they also have like a design Singapore community and even on Telegram channel they have also, a lot of everyday spam. They will say ‘hi guys, what do you feel about this’. The bad thing is that you may not really know this person very well and you dont know the quality of the feedbacks. But the good thing is oftentimes you get in touch with people you may now know. I think one of the guys who is the head of this UX agency in Singapore, with award winning projects, he’s in that. Unless you work the company or you’re friend with him,  you will not meet him. He’s very active there.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion <br>
                                    So normally people go on this kind of community to get feedbacks?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Michelle <br>
                                    Any design related thing, people even get jobs there. asking how do I bring into industry or advice or does my portfolio or they're also people looking to hire from there. So anything that about design will be on there. There’s also a separate group for people looking for research participants. They will be hard to get because sometimes companies don't have a list. Unless you are so like social butterfly. Actually it would quite cute to build a community, because only in there you can be more playful. Not all these things like work, design wise. In these community group chats, they chitchat,
                                    they have events, they host meetups. Some are more spontaneous but  I think because they already know each other. but to get to know a lot of people at the same time there'll be other events either physical or online and people will do their own sharing. so OGP do that too. So even when they implemented this scam shield thing, they’ll go and have a talk anyone is free to join. And then you get insight, they really show their design process. You will not be able to know that if you work with them or you are friends with them.  For a support kind of way, a way is to create new chat rooms for their own work. And then scheduling maybe. Okay, by all these are very boring things you can go and figure out. Yeah, so like even i send an invite, I have to ownself go and add in calendar. So you just have some integration that says connect with Google. Yeah. But I think there could be some fun in this way. Because I think designers, one thing very special about designers is we are all very, I would say quite nice, fun people, compared to business people. Nothing against them, but I think they tend to be in a certain mood when they work. We (designers) want to still feel good. All these things.<br><br>
