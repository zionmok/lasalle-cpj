                                <p>
                                    Zion <br>
                                    I have no idea what insights you are going to give me, I have no information. Whatever you’re going to give me, is going to be fresh.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Okay. Can can.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Okay. So the aim of the user interview is to understand the differences and similarities between what you do, the design thinking processes you do at work and what you do or what you teach or pass on to your students or mentees when you’re their mentor, or interns. So right now, I understand that you're working at wild cats, right? What's your main job scope?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    A lot. So it's a startup. So basically in a startup, usually it consists of a like, only a little amount of people, like very few because they're trying to build stuff. They're trying to experiment with a lot of things. So it's not as, it's not as big of a team as like different other corporations. So basically, like my job scope, I was hired to be the creative lead in the creative lead’s role, it's usually in the branding side of things or marketing side of things. So I kind of tackle like the designing of like marketing materials or basically the branding of the whole Wildcats through our social media channels and all that. But at the same time, not just that. So I also do like NFTs on the side. I also do like the website.
                                    I also do, currently now we're developing an app, so that requires also a little bit of UI actually. So I'm kind of like the all around, like designing leader of like the whole company.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    NFTs is under wildcats also?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yes. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    It’s not your own project?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Not my own project. I want to do it, *laughs* Yeah, It's a partnership between animal shelters and wildcats. So if you look at the name like Wildcats, right, You think of cats. So we wanted to create NFTs to actually benefit the cats. Yeah, it's just a small project in the company.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Is it launched yet?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah, it's already launched.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Can I look it up now?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah suresure!<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah suresure! Oh, Wildpaws NFTs. Yeah, that one. We call it felines with benefits.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Cute, do you do the rendering yourself?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    I didn’t. And I had a team with this. Oh, but I love the designs. The..<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Is it 2D or 3D?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Oh, yeah. Like, some of them. Are we call them meowtaverse cats, metaverse cats. They're basically like a bit generic cats, but they are all very unique in a sense. At the same time, you also have digital twin cats. Those digital twins are actually real life cats that are born into like, NFTs. So if you adopt like a digital cat, that twin cat, then you're actually adopting like the one in the real life shelter, which is like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    So they own the NFTs as well?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah! That's the whole premise of it.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Okay let’s officially go into the interview.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Okay. that wasn’t part of the interview? * laughs*<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    It’s part of it! *laughs* So the first question. Could you roughly describe what is the design thinking process like in Wildcats?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    In wildcats... How do i explain. Because I deal with a lot of different projects. Sometimes it's just me. Sometimes is with other people. if it's just me. What I do is I usually like research about the thing that I would need to do. Maybe like the target audience, may be, like latest trends may also be like secondary research, or if I need to, like, read on stuff or even like scrolling tiktok. That's actually like one of the research things that I need to do. Yeah, I see like latest trends and maybe somehow I kind of integrate Wildcats into it and then probably do like a TikTok dance or like a marketing material for innovation challenge or something like that. Also, I do like research on the visual design and like a lot of the trends in like in that aspect also, because if, I don't know, it's so hard to be experimental nowadays, like experimental in the sense that, will people actually like it when I put it out there or, I don't know, like sometimes if it's like to Brutalism, you know, like people don't actually like, like it. So yeah, something like that. So I do the research and then I produce and produce until like, everybody's okay with it. But the producing part is mainly like I do have a lot of options for them to choose, but everything is like done with the heart, you know? So anything that they choose, I'm okay. In terms of like, being with a team, I ask them to basically what I do, but I let them do it and then I will be the one who's actually approving this stuff. So on the side, I also do a lot of like copy change. Um, yeah, sometimes. So they do the research. I also do some research and then then they ask for approval. It kind of it's kind of like a, I don't know what it's called, but there's like a diagonal or like diamond like process for when you, you like, diverge and then you converge. so diverging, meaning like you research like everybody would just research and research and then you diverge again to see what the best viable solution will be as a team you collaborate on like what is going to work with a team and with the external audience, and then you converge again to see, to test it out, to to see if it actually works, If it doesn't work, nono, You test it out and then you converge again to see which one is like the best viable solution. So yeah, it's kind of like *draws diamond*<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    I see.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah. So I usually do that process with the team. Like a lot of like diverging and converging until we actually, like, approve on something and then forward to like the whole target audience. That's how Yeah, because I really do the, I really do like a lot of like stuff. So it's so hard to actually they just like have like one process.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    So every project is different?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    *Hums in approval*<br><br>
                                    
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    But you always start with the research?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah, always like research, front he get-go. So I don't like, when people don't research first I don't like it, because like they're trying to just assume everything. And I don't like assumptions like, especially nowadays, like assumptions are, I don't know, it leads to like fake news that leads to like a lot of, um, I don't know, bad stuff. So I read on like, assumptions. Um, I usually, like, based everything on, like, research and facts. Yeah. Especially with, like, working in social media. I really like looking at statistics and what actually, like, works, um, instead of trying to rely so much on your assumptions. I don't know. It just. It's just a waste of time for me.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Yeah, I agree. So when you say test, how do you test it with the audience?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    So you usually do it like internally. Um, sometimes like we show everybody, um, with this, like we show like some options to the teams or at the same time we show some options to maybe like outside the team more on the external team. That's some of the clients that we're working with, some of the partners we're working with also, um, also like the executive team that we have, are very much engaged with the approval process, although we say that we're not hierarchical, but it's so inevitable to be like that. So yeah, so a lot of , like, approvals from there.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    So hierarchy based on experience?<br><br>

                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah, yeah, experience. Because sometimes you deal with those who have a lot of experience in innovation, you have a lot you deal with some people who are actually like super good at marketing and then at the same time like, you know, they sometimes don't gel well together. It's kind of like, oh, it was not a good yeah, has a lot of things.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    How about the students? How do you facilitate their design process? How do you teach design process.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Oh, with the current students I have now?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Maybe current, maybe lasalle, maybe outside interns that you get. Yeah. How do you teach them or guide them into the project I guess.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Okay, maybe my example would be like the students I have now. I really try to like, give as much they can in the nine weeks that we only have and then only the nine weeks like you only have, like what, Like six weeks of actually like teaching stuff. So I, in the whole three years I spent in this lasalle, I wasn't really taught so much of the design thinking process until I had an internship with chemistry, chemistry is this like, innovation consultancy design thinking, also very design-centric part, social innovation, design centric, something like that. Yeah. You get a multidisciplinary consultancy, something like that. Yeah. So I had an internship with them and then they gave me so much insight about like the design thinking process. I had my own ways back in lasalle when I did my final year project, but I feel like by using the design thinking process, I, I did better in like my job after lasalle, after graduating because I feel like we are we constantly assume things when we're in uni. And then, I mean, you don't get like immediate approval from our lecturers, right? So we just try and try and we are we like finalize on our like product part on our like design solution, whatever. So for me especially like, especially like graduating, like I wanted to have that process in mind. So, and it worked for me and I feel like it would also work for my student because at least they would have like a process. And then if they get lost, then we go back to that process and then start over again. It's it's like an integration process that we can always gel into. It might not work, but at least I'm trying.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Okay, tell me more about what's your design thinking process like? Is it the 5-steps process?<br><br>

                                    Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Correct. Like empathy, ideation and and yeah. Oh yeah. Empathy ideation, definition, prototype and test.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Yes. Yeah.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    It’s super ingrained. Yeah. So I wanted, also the diamond thing. Yeah. Because it's usually, how do you put it, so everything is in a diamond, like the empathy is also in a diamond because you converge and then you diverge again and again and all that. Yeah. It's, it's actually the diamonds are there for a reason. Yeah. So I wanted to at least, like, especially now. Oh my God, I've forgotten all this stuff. Now that it's the digital age, it's so hard to actually keep track of things. So design thinking, especially when you're creating an app or a website, it's so effective to use. <br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    I see. I agree with you also. I really follow the step by step, cause I get lost, I tend to get lost. So I always refer back to the steps.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    When you get lost in your thoughts, you'll be, *die* Yeah, it's good. Yeah. Yeah.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    So, uh, with experience with students. What the common challenges that they face within this process.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    The common challenges?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Yeah.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Hm, as young people. I think we're always not sure of things. Um, and we constantly need approval to, like, go on, uh, I, I don't know. I feel like at least with my students, um, I think they're doing well, but like, I feel like they would always need to hear that, okay, this is good. Like that kind of phrase. Like, Oh, okay, this, this idea works, you know, So that they have, like, a sense of approval to, like, go on, to move on. But I feel without it, you tend to get lost. You try to like iterate and iterate until like nothing is actually done. I feel like, I don't know, back in the day, like I don't know about you, but like my lectures really never gave us answers. Oh, yasser, kidding. No lah no lah, it's they never give us answers, but they give us questions to actually explore more, which I feel is also very relevant in today's climate, like, it's really this is that's what mentorship is about. It's actually not giving solutions, but more like finding more and exploring more of like the questions that you're given. Right? Um, but yeah, the challenges of really like seeking approval, I feel.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Which part of the diamond would you say it belongs to?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Oh, what a great question. I actually don't know. I feel it's the ideation part and definition part.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Between ideation and definition?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah, between that. Because when you define things, that's, it's, it's already making a decision. Every time you converge, you're creating a decision, right? You're making a decision there that it's like in the empathy phase, when you diverge, it's fine because you're, you're trying to explore. But when you're trying to actually figure out the target audience, you're like, Is this right? Is this okay? And then if you actually, like, decide from there, you, you, you diverge again. And then again it's like, Oh yeah, I have to create a decision again. So every decision is like, I don't know, it's just very.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Oh, it’s all the converge part?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    yeah, yeah.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    I see I see.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    So actually. Yeah. So it's not, it's probably not just the definition and ideation part. It's every time you converge on things where you have to create a decision that's always like a hard part because you're deciding already.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Deciding by not sure if it's correct?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Yeah, yes.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    Yeah. Would you say that when you were younger you also had that problem?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    Until now and I’m having that problem. Deciding is such a hard thing, now I I'm considered a manager by my level of experience. I find it very hard to have decisions like every day in my life, especially when it comes to people like I manage like a team. Um, now we're trying to like, cut some people and it's hard to like let go of people. like, trying to talk to them and all that. So it's not even like me as a designer and all. It's really like me managing a lot of people. Yeah. So every day, every day is a struggle.<br><br>
                                    
                                    Zion<br>
                                    How do you, how do you decide? How do you force yourself to decide?<br><br>
                                    
                                    Rox<br>
                                    At times I just do it. Um, it might be a personal thing, but I sometimes pray. Yeah, I pray sometimes, but most of the time I actually seek the help of others. Also with regards to some decision making, because I. I know I won't have the answers all the time. And I know there will be always someone who is actually more reliable than me in terms of like, some stuff. Creative wise, I think I'm okay. But like in terms of like other stuff, it's like, for example, like my superior is like better at innovation decision like, so I will go to him for like some decisions on, like whether or not to pursue this innovative like structure or something. So then I have like my marketing manager and then I would ask her for some tips and some other stuff regarding some materials and all that. So but like creativity wise, I think I can make my own decisions but like sometimes that he always that someone else.. Yeah, I won't be able to do it without.<br><br>
