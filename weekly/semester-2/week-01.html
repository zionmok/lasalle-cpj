                                <p>Last week, Joselyn reminded us that we should somewhat finalise our discussion points by the first consultation, so we can get constructive feedback for it and continue working on it through the following week. Gideon has also given us some feedback on how our studio can improve. For my projects, he mentioned that my take on “uncovering the attributes of design thinking” could be presented stronger and clearer by expanding on why am I doing it, for example “as a way of questioning its relevance today”. I could take this comment onto my dissertation discussion points. <br><br>

                               <p> Previously, my discussion was split into 3 points: <br><br>
                                1.   How are design thinking processes impacting the design industry in terms of communication between teams and stakeholders? <br><br>
                                2.   How can young designers adapt better to the design industry with the help of design thinking guides that are less rigid?
                                What are some benefits young designers can get from systematic design thinking guides? <br><br>
                                3. I would like to nudge my take on the subject more towards the systematic side.</p>

                               <p> During the cohort presentation, I was paying attention to how they presented their projects. As the presenters were selected for their good practices, I wanted to learn a few things from them. <br> <br>

                                There were some similarities in the way they presented their projects. One of them is how they constructed a project title that is suitable for their project. They then designed their deck according to that message. Their decks were of a cohesive art direction. It might sound obvious but many of us couldn’t finalise a project title. I can’t speak for everyone, but at least for myself, I waited until the last minute to put a name on my project. I’m still not too sure what the main message of my project would be, therefore I was not confident enough to settle.</p>

                                    <p>The art direction that caught my attention was this project about Green Narratives. She had this green colour that with black text. It was just green and black, but it was used intentionally in places that made the whole design look clean.</p>
                                    <p>Another thing I want to do for the future of my presentation is to have a cohesive art direction. It’s obvious in these students’ slides that they have chosen a style to go for, like branding their own project. Previously, I added some rawness in my style with handwritten texts and lines, against a white background. In hindsight, it wasn’t enough.</p>
